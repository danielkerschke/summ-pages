Note: This guy was mostly unresponsive during his adolescence, so I wondered how about in what sense his mind was underdeveloped when he came out of it, but the book doesn't seem to talk about that.

As a child Martin becomes sick very quickly. Doctors cannot name the disease. Scans and treatments offer no solution. His speech fades, his body stiffens, his hands curl, and he stops responding in ways that people can see. In time the medical system gives up and advises institutional care. His parents bring him home and struggle to keep him fed and safe. The last thing he clearly asks is a small, aching question to his mother about when he can go home, and then the words stop coming. This is the setup of the book’s long middle: a boy alive inside a body that no longer answers back. 

The memoir spends careful time inside the non-responsive years. Martin describes a world where time is measured by light on a wall, the sound of a radio, and the rhythm of routine. Days at a care center pass in long stretches of waiting to be moved, fed, cleaned, and taken home. This is not drama in the usual sense, yet it is powerful because the clock moves so slowly, and because he is aware. He feels the tedium, he hears what people say around him, and he can do almost nothing to affect any of it. 

Awareness returns by degrees. He compares it to rising from the seabed toward light. Sensations sharpen, voices make sense, and objects resolve into focus. He remains mostly unable to move, though, so he cannot show anyone that he is back. This is one of the most haunting parts of the book, because it underlines a simple truth. Being conscious and being able to show consciousness are not the same thing, and when those do not line up, other people make the wrong call about who you are. 

Because he cannot respond reliably, Martin is sorted into the wrong mental box. He is treated as if he has a very low IQ, and that label shapes what people do with him. The staff aim low. Activities are designed for someone far younger. The problem is not cruelty in every case, it is the speed with which people stop expecting anything at all. The book returns to this point over and over, pressing the reader to notice how much of our judgment rests on outward signals. 

His family’s story runs in parallel. His father shoulders exhausting daily care, lifting and washing and turning him at night. His mother, overwhelmed by sorrow and isolation, breaks down and even attempts suicide before later growing steadier and slowly coming close to him again. The book does not make heroes or villains out of his parents. It shows the cost of chronic crisis inside a household, and the way love can look like stubborn routine when nothing flashy is left to do. 

The care systems he moves through are not all the same. Some places are humane. Others are bleak, like the home where he is parked in a fenced yard with nothing to do, like an exhibit. He listens for a car that might be his rescue and tries to keep hope alive. These chapters explain why simple details matter so much when you cannot change your own situation. A radio, a kind word, a familiar face, even predictable pickup times can feel like anchors in an otherwise drifting day. 

There is also frank testimony about abuse. When a caregiver has power over a person who cannot object, lines can be crossed. Martin describes being pinched or slapped, left outside in heat or cold, handled roughly, humiliated in ways that are both physical and psychological, and then sent home with cheerful reports about a “good stay.” He notes that abusers often look like ordinary people, and that silence makes them bold. 

The turning point begins with a person who looks at him and truly sees him. Virna, a relief caregiver who also gives him aromatherapy massages, talks to him as if he understands. She watches his eyes and expressions until she is certain he does. In a world where many speak around him, she speaks to him. She then pushes for an assessment at a university center that specializes in helping people who cannot speak find ways to communicate. The importance of this chapter is simple and profound. One person’s attention can pry open a door that institutions left shut.

At the Center for Augmentative and Alternative Communication at the University of Pretoria, two clinicians, Shakila and Yasmin, try to map what he can control. They use a clear board with pictures to track his eye fixations. They introduce a head switch and a slow dial with symbols, so he can stop a pointer when it reaches the target. When he stops the pointer at the right picture, it is his first felt moment of control in years. They also show him a simple speech-generating device called a Macaw, where a light moves across squares and a user can select a word or phrase. The device speaks a recorded sentence, and he hears an electronic voice say something on behalf of a person who cannot. That tiny demonstration is the seed of his freedom.

His parents take a leap. They decide to buy him technology so he can communicate. When currency troubles make the dedicated device too expensive, they pivot and get him a laptop with specialized software instead. He begins with the basics, single words and symbols, and then builds pages of vocabulary. His mother quits her job for a time to help him practice for hours each day and even marches into a computer shop to insist on the fastest machine available, because she refuses to let the tool be the bottleneck. The scenes of this home training are both tender and technical. You see how communication is built brick by brick.

A small early triumph shows the stakes. One Christmas he uses his software to compose a short greeting, and the family holds a phone to the speakers so his sister can hear his computer voice. The moment is brief, yet it lands like a bell. For the first time in years his thoughts travel outward in words that other people can recognize as his. The “ghost boy” starts to become a man who can say what he wants and what he needs. 

Once he can speak through the computer, doors open. He begins testing software for a company in the United Kingdom, organizes files, and discovers that computers make sense to him in ways that even he cannot fully explain. He also gives a talk at a university workshop to a room of students, describing the long climb back into language. The details are humble. He still needs help with doors and drinks and bathrooms, and he reflects on how exhausting social life can be when your words move slower than the conversation. Still, he is working, learning, and being treated as an adult.

The heart chapter for many readers is the love story. Through his sister, Martin meets Joanna, a social worker in England. Emails turn into nightly chats. The ease of their conversation surprises him, since in the past he has often been seen as a friend but not a partner. Joanna invites him to join a trip, and what follows is a steady deepening of trust and affection. The writing here is warm and open. It shows him as a fully rounded person who can flirt, plan, doubt, and hope.

He proposes, using a recorded message to say what his own vocal cords cannot. Joanna says yes. They marry in June 2009, sort through the boxes of his past, and then prepare for a move to England. The book does not present this as a magic finish. It is a new beginning threaded with practical challenges, and also a statement about what love notices that institutions missed. Love pays attention to the person inside the body, and it waits long enough to hear what that person is trying to say.
