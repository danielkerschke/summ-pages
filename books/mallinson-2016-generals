Mallinson, A. (2016). Too important for the generals: Winning and losing the first world war. London, UK: Penguin Books.

**The point of this book is that World War I dragged on in endless “meatgrinder” stalemates because armies were still using old habits in the face of new technology, and the generals in charge clung to grand visions instead of managing the fight with practical sense. World War II was different in many ways, because logistics, planning, and coordination improved dramatically—people often say the war was really won by American production lines and supply chains. Still, even with all that progress, World War II had its own horrific slogs: Stalingrad’s frozen hell, the brutal fighting at Monte Cassino, the tank clash at Kursk, the nightmare of Okinawa, the grinding crawl up Italy, and the forests of Hürtgen where soldiers were known to cannibalize their enemies.**

the big idea is simple. wars are started for political goals, so strategy has to keep those goals in charge the whole time. when that chain breaks, armies start solving the wrong problem in the wrong place with the wrong tools, and bodies pile up. Mallinson opens by saying the First World War dragged on and bled millions largely because strategy and generalship failed at the top. he pushes back on the comfy idea that “well, frontal attacks were the only way.” he says no. the real failure was letting generals run a political project with military habits, and shutting out strong political minds like Churchill who were trying to think about the whole board, not just the next trench. That is what Clemenceau’s line means: war is too important to be left to the generals. It must stay anchored to political purpose, or the fighting will wander and waste itself.

To make that concrete, he leans on Clausewitz. Think of three nested layers. Policy is the “why” of the war, strategy is the “how, in broad strokes,” and tactics are the “what exactly we do this week.” (Everyone has heard the Clausewitz quote, but this is what it actually means. In English he had been paraphrased as “politics by other means,” which some took to mean politics ends when the guns start. That is wrong.)

Now, the early plans. Picture two big clocks set to collide. Germany built a plan to win fast by swinging a massive “right arm” through Belgium and around Paris, inspired by Hannibal’s encirclement at Cannae. It was elegant on paper and risky in reality, because it underweighted politics and logistics. Violating Belgian neutrality would likely bring Britain in, and the right wing had to move huge forces across long distances in time and space that were tight even for German railways. Meanwhile the French chose a doctrine of pure attack in Alsace-Lorraine, the border zone they ached to reclaim. Their plan assumed the German main punch would land there. It did not. The two plans fit like a trap: while France lunged into Alsace-Lorraine, Germany’s main masses flowed through Belgium into the open French flank. That is how you open the door to a million enemy soldiers on your soil before anyone can say “maybe we miscalculated.”

Britain’s part in this went wrong before the first shot. The understaffed War Office had allowed one detailed plan to harden like concrete: ship the small British Expeditionary Force straight to the French left at Maubeuge, immediately, and fight as an extra French corps. A good staff gives ministers options. Instead, Whitehall got a single “take it or leave it” scheme. When crisis came, the cabinet had Hobson’s choice. That rigidity mattered, because if the BEF is tiny, throwing it into the strongest meat grinder on day one risks losing your only trained core. One of Mallinson’s core points is that Britain should have kept strategy elastic, asking “what if” instead of pretending the future would follow the War Office’s favorite timetable.

Here’s an alternative Mallinson highlights. In 1911, Churchill wrote a memo that basically predicted the German sweep through Belgium and said France would win in France, not on the border. His advice was: do not rush the BEF into frontier battles. Concentrate it inland near Tours, build it up, add heavy guns, bring Indian divisions through Marseille, and commit when Germany was overextended around the fortieth day of mobilization. That is exactly the window when the Allies struck at the Marne. The idea is intuitive. Let the invader stretch, then hit the bent arm at the elbow. It prioritizes “ultimate success” over flashy early moments. Mallinson uses this to show that political leaders can think clearly about war’s whole shape, sometimes better than the professionals stuck inside a narrow groove.

Why did Britain not act that way? Two reasons. First, culture and administration. The BEF was small because Britain relied on a volunteer system and global garrisons, not a mass reserve. Second, personalities. Henry Wilson loved the French staff and planned with them in microscopic detail, down to train timetables, which blurred the line between “we can mobilize” and “we must deploy to this spot.” Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, actually saw the risk at the eleventh hour and told the French ambassador that sending the BEF at once would bring maximum risk for minimum effect. But by then there was no well-developed Plan B, and the political mood made doing nothing feel impossible. When you forget options, panic chooses for you.
-- **So what actually happened?** The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) wasn’t annihilated in a single gulp, but it was thrown straight into the teeth of Germany’s advance at Mons and then the retreat that followed. They fought with skill and slowed the German timetable, but they were so small that every loss hurt badly. By the end of 1914, the original professional core was basically gone, replaced by new volunteers who had far less training. In late 1914 and through 1915, Kitchener raised the “New Armies” of volunteers, but training, guns, shells, and staff work lagged, so the force grew in bodies before it grew in quality. Conscription in 1916 plus months of training, far more artillery, better logistics, and more experienced officers finally turned that mass into a fuller army. By the Somme in mid-1916 you can see the larger, better-equipped machine, even if it was still rough and learning under fire. The real polish shows more in 1917.

Indeed, Kitchener saw the long war on day one and set out to build a citizen mass army big enough to decide things by 1917. That vision was right, but during this time the military's resources would be split. You are already fighting with a small force while building the big one you need later, which takes experienced trainers, modern weapons, and months of organization you do not yet have. Without a patient strategy that shields the build-up, you end up feeding half-trained units into battles shaped by someone else’s timetable. That is exactly what happened, and why conscription arrived mid-war rather than before.

By 1915 the real wound is visible. There is no coherent Allied grand strategy that links sea power, industry, new armies, and political aims into one plan. The generals on the Western Front, backed by a War Office that liked simple “win here by wearing them down” thinking, kept pulling the rope the same way. The Admiralty could not get its broader maritime leverage to dominate the conversation. Mallinson’s verdict is that strategy had been handed to the wrong place in the system, so operations became “higher tactics” rather than true strategy (which would have involved the generals yielding to the admirals). That is why the year settles into deadlock, with offensives that pay in blood but do not alter the strategic geometry at all.

start with 1917, the year of bright promises that curdled. General Nivelle sold a clean, mechanized breakthrough on the Chemin des Dames. the plan looked scientific. in reality, the Germans hid on the reverse slope, the weather turned bad, and German air tactics blunted the giant French air fleet. the British “helping” attack at Arras and Vimy Ridge showed impressive artillery science and raw courage, but could not turn speed into deep success because the roads, guns, and reserves behind the line jammed up. the casualty rate was catastrophic. this is the pattern Mallinson wants you to see. a pretty operational idea with no honest accounting of enemy adaptation, terrain, and logistics turns into a slog the moment it meets contact. when a plan depends on the enemy behaving, treat it like a fairy tale, not a forecast. The generals didn't just neglect "grand strategy" planning, but also anything that went beyond "proper fighting".

The same actually was true for France and Germany. The French doctrine literally wrote “the offensive admits no law,” which taught officers to believe that attacking was right almost no matter what. When you begin with that belief, you look at the map with your answer already chosen, so you miss the obvious clue that the main German strike would come through Belgium rather than straight at Alsace and Lorraine. Germany had a matching blind spot. Its planners idolized the old encirclement at Cannae, as if copying a famous checkmate guaranteed a win in a completely different game. While chasing that elegant shape, they discounted politics, such as the near certainty that invading Belgium would bring Britain into the war, and they underplayed supply, meaning fuel, spare parts, rail capacity, horse fodder, and all the dull things that actually move an army. A German field marshal later joked that prewar staff training kept hands clean by avoiding anything that might get oil on them, which was a neat way of admitting that logistics had been treated as beneath the theory. 

For another example, look at Passchendaele: the 1917 slog where British troops fought for months through mud, rain, and German fire to seize a ridge and a village that cost hundreds of thousands of lives yet altered almost nothing in the long term. Haig, the British commander, swung between two approaches. One was “bite and hold”—small, heavily supported gains that stuck. The other was the fantasy of a sweeping breakthrough to the coast. He leaned toward the fantasy exactly when patience was needed most. Plumer, another British general, was steadier. He believed in careful, limited advances, and when the conditions of ground and artillery were right, his method did work. But Haig pressed him to chase the bigger dream, but soon rain, mustard gas, and fresh German divisions broke down that effort. The higher direction was little more than a vague wish.

early 1918 shows the bill coming due. Germany threw its last big dice with the spring offensives. in the British Fifth Army sector the line cracked. the Germans advanced fast across the wrecked old Somme battlefield, then started to slow for very human reasons. food and alcohol from captured depots tugged at discipline, and the terrain itself, smashed by years of shells, chewed up momentum. Nevertheless, panic stirred in Paris and London; for a moment, it really looked like the Germans might actually win, because their spring offensive broke the stalemate, smashed through the British lines, advanced dozens of miles in days, and even brought Paris within artillery range—an abrupt, shocking shift after years where the front had barely moved. That is when unity of command finally happened. General Foch was appointed to coordinate all allied armies on the Western Front so the coalition could act like one mind. This is the political fix the author has been demanding all along. in a coalition, victory needs one steering wheel, not three.

by late summer the idea of the offensive finally fit the situation; it was the correct response, no longer a General's fantasy. As their breakthrough offensive went on, German reserves were spent, the British naval blockade had hollowed the rear, American forces were arriving, and the allies were now practicing combined arms like a habit instead of an experiment. that is why the “Hundred Days” could roll forward in linked blows. the logic is simple. when time, logistics, morale, and command unity lean your way, attacking is efficient. when they do not, attacking is charity to the enemy. most of 1915 to 1917 was charity. the late 1918 sequence was collection day.
-- The Allies held the line at the Marne, then hit back. In August at Amiens they punched the Germans hard and kept hitting in a rolling series of attacks called the Hundred Days. The Germans were pushed off the Hindenburg Line, their partners started collapsing, their people at home were starving and angry, and the German army lost the will to keep going. That is how it went from breakthrough to stall to retreat to armistice.

### What is the cultural background to the Generals acting this way? 

It seems like leftover habits that had to be violently purged. Perhaps European militaries once had to protect themselves against political interference in the past? There seems to be a common narrative of untested ideals, such as glorious attack in France, the Schlieffen plan, or Wilson's deployment plan for the British Expeditionary Force which was optimized down to the time tables. Unfortunately, the author does not say. I think this might hint at a larger change that WW1 wrought; as I hint above, WW2 was decidedly different. Tradition and honour was replaced by rational management across the board.
