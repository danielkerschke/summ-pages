Anna Lembke’s core model is a simple picture you can hold in your head. Imagine a seesaw with pleasure on one side and pain on the other. Any rewarding hit tips the plank toward pleasure because dopamine, a chemical messenger in the brain’s reward system, surges upward. The seesaw does not like to stay tipped. It automatically pushes back toward level, then keeps going to the pain side for a bit before settling. That short dip to the pain side is why a good thing is followed by a craving for more, or by a subtle letdown. She uses this seesaw to explain why modern life, stuffed with fast, strong rewards, breeds compulsive overuse and burnout. The picture is intuitive, but it is rooted in solid neuroscience on dopamine and opponent processes that link pleasure and pain in overlapping brain circuits (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

To make the model concrete, she starts with how dopamine works at the level of cells. Neurons talk to each other with neurotransmitters. Think pitcher and catcher, with the synapse as the space between. Dopamine is one of those thrown baseballs, and in the reward pathway that connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens and then to the prefrontal cortex, it is a key signal for reinforcement. Importantly, dopamine is more about wanting than liking. Mice that cannot make dopamine do not seek food on their own, yet will still chew and show signs of enjoyment if you put food in their mouths. Wanting moves the body toward rewards. Liking is the brief pleasure when the reward lands. This split matters, because addictions hijack wanting even when liking fades (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

She then gives a rough ruler for how “addictive” different rewards are by showing the size of the dopamine rise they provoke in lab animals. For a rat, chocolate bumps dopamine about 55 percent above baseline. Sexual activity is closer to 100 percent. Nicotine climbs around 150 percent. Cocaine can hit roughly 225 percent. Amphetamine and methamphetamine can spike around 1,000 percent, which is why one hit can feel like many natural rewards rolled into one. The point is not that these substances contain dopamine. They trigger the brain to release it, and the speed and height of the spike track with addictive potential. Faster, higher, and more reliable spikes mean stronger learning and stronger habits that form around the drug or behavior (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

Here is where the seesaw earns its keep. Pleasure and pain are not handled in separate mental countries. They live in overlapping neighborhoods of the brain, and they oppose each other in a push-pull dynamic. When dopamine sends the seesaw up on the pleasure side, homeostatic forces push it back toward level, then nudge it below level to the pain side. Lembke gives this a human face by imagining little gremlins jumping onto the pain side after a pleasure spike. They jump off once balance returns, but they always overshoot a little. That overshoot is the after-reaction you feel as restlessness or craving once the party ends. This is classic opponent process theory applied to everyday reward. It explains why what goes up comes down, and why the down invites another up if you keep chasing relief with the same stimulus (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

If you repeat a strong pleasure often, the seesaw adapts. The gremlins learn your moves. In brain terms, repeated exposure leads to neuroadaptation. The initial pleasure spike gets smaller and shorter. The after-reaction on the pain side gets bigger and lasts longer. You need more of the thing to achieve the same effect, and you enjoy it less. That is tolerance. Keep going and your baseline shifts. The seesaw now rests a little toward the pain side. Your hedonic set point has moved. You feel flat or irritable in the absence of the stimulus, and ordinary pleasures do not land. This is how chasing comfort can breed discomfort in the long run (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

Her clinic gave her a front-row seat to how this plays out with opioids. Many patients on long-term high-dose opioids for pain reported worse pain over time, plus new areas of pain. The model predicts this. Opioids gave large, repeated dopamine and pain-relief spikes. The system pushed back with a larger opponent response. The baseline slid toward pain. This specific phenomenon is called opioid-induced hyperalgesia. When patients tapered down, many improved, which fits the idea that removing the repeated spike lets the seesaw drift back toward level over weeks to months (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

At the molecular and circuit level, the chronic overdrive shows up as a dopamine deficit state. Work by Nora Volkow and colleagues, which Lembke summarizes for lay readers, shows that people with heavy, prolonged use of high-dopamine drugs exhibit reduced dopamine signaling and fewer available D2 receptors in key reward regions, even after a couple of weeks off the drug. Brain images show the reward hub going quiet. In plain terms, the system is less responsive to natural rewards. Nothing feels good, and that blunted state pulls people back to the drug for temporary relief, which deepens the cycle (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

Learning glues the whole pattern together. Cues that predict rewards, like a notification chime or a certain street corner, gain power. When a cue appears, dopamine blips up in anticipation, tipping the seesaw to pleasure for a moment, then dips below baseline if the expected reward does not arrive. That dip is craving. You feel worse than before the cue, and the fastest way to climb out is to consume. This is why triggers are dangerous in early recovery and why prediction errors matter. The brain is constantly forecasting rewards, and the mismatch between forecast and reality pulls behavior like a magnet (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3). 

Uncertainty adds rocket fuel. In gambling studies, dopamine release is largest when wins and losses are about equally likely. The most reinforcing schedule is not constant reward, it is variable reward. This is the slot machine effect. Pathological gamblers show big dopamine responses to losing spins when the outcome is unpredictable, which keeps them “loss chasing.” Lembke connects the same logic to social media, where likes arrive on capricious schedules that keep anticipation high and the seesaw wobbling. The model treats uncertainty as a multiplier on wanting, which is why variable, intermittent, and rapid-fire digital rewards can feel so sticky (Lembke, 2021, ch. 3).
