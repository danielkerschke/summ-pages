Marci, C. D. (2022). Rewired: Protecting your brain in the digital age. Harvard University Press.

In Rewired, Dr. Carl Marci establishes that dopamine is the fundamental neurochemical that makes digital interactions feel so compelling. It is the brain's primary reward signal, released during activities essential for survival and social bonding, such as eating, sex, and connecting with others. The book explains that social media platforms have effectively tapped into this ancient biological mechanism. The simple act of self-disclosure—sharing our thoughts and experiences—triggers this reward system. This explains the almost magnetic pull of platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which are built around personal expression. As Marci notes by citing a foundational study, this mechanism is powerful and innate: “One brain-scanning study has shown that when we disclose our inner thoughts to others, the brain releases dopamine, much as it does when we eat chocolate, take drugs, or have sex.” This positions our engagement with social media not as a simple pastime, but as an activity that directly stimulates the same reward pathways as our most basic survival behaviors.
