# Chapter 2. The Lethal Hold of Drugs

The chapter opens at a small funeral chapel on East Hastings. The priest speaks warmly about Sharon, a woman remembered for energy and humor. The room is half empty. A handful of Portland Hotel staff and residents have come. Sharon had once been strikingly beautiful. Years of injection drug use changed her appearance and damaged her body. She lived with chronic HIV. Two large areas on her left shin lost skin from infections caused by injecting. Surgeons tried skin grafts more than once. Each time, new infections ruined the grafts. A bone infection in her left knee flared up and settled in cycles. She could not complete weeks of intravenous antibiotics in hospital because she could not tolerate being there that long. She ended up using a wheelchair in her thirties, pushing herself very fast with her arms and her good leg. During the service, the priest’s familiar words feel comforting rather than empty. Mourners file past the open casket. Beverly, whose face shows cocaine picking scars, leans in. Penny, bent over a walker after a spinal infection, pays her respects. Tom, often drunk and loud on the street, stands sober in a white shirt and tie. Sharon’s face looks young and uncertain, which fits the vulnerable person many knew behind her loud exterior.

The circumstances of Sharon’s death are simple and bleak. Staff found her lying on her side in bed, looking peaceful, probably dead from an overdose. There was no drug equipment in the room. She likely injected in a neighbor’s unit and returned to hers. The timing felt brutal because she had just spent months in a recovery residence. She kept phoning the clinic for her methadone prescription so she would not have to come near Hastings Street. Staff who visited her reported better color, enthusiasm, and hope. Despite that, she had relapsed to heroin. Her death shocked people who had seen her sharp humor, her speed in that wheelchair, and her stubborn drive to keep going. After the service, the sunlight is bright. People gather in the parking lot and talk about staying alive, staying abstinent, and getting through the next medical hurdle. The scene underlines what the chapter insists on throughout. A person can be loved, supported, and still pulled back by a compulsion that remains stronger than fear, stronger than shame, and stronger than any warning.

We meet the attendees.  Gail’s story illustrates the tight link between sobriety and lifesaving care. Two years earlier she had a severe abdominal infection and ended up with a colostomy. Her bowel was diverted into a bag on her belly to allow healing. Surgeons wanted to rejoin the bowel, but the operation kept getting canceled because she was still injecting cocaine. The original surgeon refused to book her again after multiple cancellations. A new surgeon agreed to operate if she stayed off cocaine. When the chapter’s narrator meets her at the funeral, she is 87 days abstinent. She talks about how much she hates changing the bag, sometimes several times a day. She is determined to reach the clean window needed for surgery. Tom greets the doctor kindly. Penny, who spent six months on intravenous antibiotics for a spinal infection that left her hunched and weak, says she never expected to outlive Sharon. She laughs with the doctor about how close she came to dying the previous summer. These brief exchanges show that people are not abstractions. They carry infections, scars, and disabilities. They also carry loyalty, humor, and plans. And still, addiction can keep control even when the stakes are obvious. The chapter does not look away from that conflict. It shows it in plain scenes with everyday words.

The narrator then faces the central question. **Why does the compulsion to use survive illness, pain, and the loss of almost everything?** A former patient named Ralph once described how, in a wartime camp, men risked their lives for a cigarette. Whether or not the history is exact, the point is clear. People will risk severe punishment to make a terrible moment a little more bearable. That is the logic of the fix. **The narrator pushes back against the popular idea that negative consequences teach people to stop**. If that were true, fast food would not sell, living rooms would have fewer televisions, and harsh policy would have ended drug use years ago. The chapter argues that fear and shame are weak tools in the face of what the drug gives. That is the pivot. **Understanding the hold requires understanding the relief.** Without that, medicine, policy, and family rules will keep missing the target. The examples that follow are not neat case studies. They are short, blunt conversations with people who are sick, tired, and still reaching for substances that harm them.

Hal is one example. He is in his forties, friendly, and not involved in crime. He has HIV and a badly infected leg from injecting speed. The leg is red, hot, swollen, and painful. He needs daily intravenous antibiotics at the emergency department. He still injects. When asked why, he struggles to answer. He describes a pattern many users know. The drug makes speech thick, thoughts slow, and the body slack within minutes. Then the cycle repeats. He dislikes the effects but does it again. **The benefit is hard for him to name in words, yet the behavior continues despite the cost.** The conversation shows two truths at once. The medical facts are clear. The leg is infected. The immune system is strained. The long term risk includes disability and death. The lived truth is also clear. **The immediate pull is not a distant idea about pain relief. It is a habit tied to mood, memory, and setting. It is a practiced response to stress. It is a routine with powerful cues.** This is not a moral excuse. It is an observation that helps explain why medical advice alone often fails.

Continuing the theme of why people do things they suspect will kill them, the author discusses the case of one Allan. He has a strong family history of heart disease. He is a heavy smoker. He has HIV and hepatitis C. He has heart failure and a past infection of his heart valves from injecting drugs. He goes to one hospital with chest pain and likely endocarditis. After being brushed off by two hospitals, he then asks the author what to do. The doctor explains the facts, pointing out that the obvious next step is heart failure, if he continues taking drugs. Allan understands and even asks to be told bluntly. Nevertheless, four months later he is dead on his hotel room floor after injecting a stolen batch of methadone that was adulterated with other drugs. In the middle of these events he voices something many clients say. He is not afraid of dying. He is more afraid of living as he has known it. Others echo the same idea with different words. Nothing bothers them when they are high. There is no stress. The next morning is worse, but the pattern is set. The threat of later loss does not outweigh the relief of the moment.

There are more case studies. Alvin, a former long distance trucker in his fifties, is on methadone for heroin. He has started using crystal meth. The first hit each day makes him nauseated. He keeps going anyway. After several inhales he feels a brief high that lasts only minutes. Then he feels foolish and regrets it, yet repeats the cycle. He spends about a thousand dollars a month. He says he hates it, and at the same time he compares the high to a short burst of sexual pleasure. The chapter places these candid admissions beside cultural accounts. A writer, Stephen Reid, once described the first narcotic he used at age eleven as making ordinary things feel vivid and significant. Leonard Cohen once wrote that cigarettes feel like they promise something beautiful and saving. The point is not to romanticize drugs. The point is to name their functions. They reduce emotional pain. They dull emptiness. They lift boredom. They blunt stress. They grease social contact. They sometimes produce a quick sensation that feels like a spiritual opening. For many in the Downtown Eastside, these functions carry lethal risk. For others in safer settings, similar functions fuel other compulsive habits.
- “*Here’s what I’m hearing,” I counter. “For the privilege of being nauseated and feeling like a fool, you spend a thousand dollars a month. Is this what you’re telling me?” Alvin laughs. “I only puke on the first one of the day, though. I get a high of some sort, which lasts about three to five minutes, and then…you say to yourself, Why did I do that? But then it’s too late. Something makes you keep doing it, and that’s what’s called addiction.*"

The chapter does address biology, but carefully. Drugs change brain chemistry. That is true. **The brain is not separate from life events, stress, and relationships. That is also true. People in the book rarely hide behind a purely medical model. They know the drug eases something that hurts.** That is why the narrator keeps asking not only what the drug does in the brain, but what it does in the person. Reducing the problem to willpower or punishment does not match what he sees in clinic rooms, alleys, and hospital wards. He makes a practical point. If we keep ignoring what people get from the drug, our interventions miss the mark. Methadone helps for some. Supervised injection reduces harm for others. Medical care saves limbs and lives daily. Still, many return to use because pain, fear, and isolation persist. The chapter’s stories aim to make readers look at the full picture. Bodies carry abscesses and viruses. Minds carry trauma, shame, and anxiety. The drug belongs to both stories at once. Any plan that ignores either side will not hold.

The chapter ends by returning to Sharon. There is a photo of her at her sponsor’s home, in a black bathing suit, feet in a pool, looking calm and ready for a next chapter that never came. Despite twelve years in the Downtown Eastside, she could not complete the twelve steps. For a long time, she was barred from even visiting the Portland Hotel because her behavior was too violent and unpredictable. She was accepted later as a resident when her options ran out. A program director sums up the cruel logic of that environment. Some people are too much trouble to live there. Others are so much trouble that it is the only place they can live. For many, it is also the only place they die.
