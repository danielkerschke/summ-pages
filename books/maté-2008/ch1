# Chapter 1: The Only Home He’s Ever Had

The chapter opens on Hastings Street in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, outside the Portland Hotel where the author works as a physician. He steps into a street scene filled with people he knows by name. Eva, thin and restless, moves in a jittery dance locals call the Hastings shuffle. Randall, bright and eccentric, sits in a motorized wheelchair and talks in long, winding riffs about history and transport. Arlene stands nearby, wary and scarred from years of self harm, worried that her medication might be reduced. Police briefly search Jenkins, a quiet Indigenous man, then let him go. Matthew, one leg and a mischievous grin, cuts through the moment with kind humor. The author admits to feeling saturated by it all and wanting to leave. His son Daniel pulls up to drive him home, and together they look back at the sidewalk where the neighborhood keeps moving. This opening does not rush. It gives names, habits, and tensions, so the reader understands that the people in front of the clinic are not a blur. They are individuals, with specific stories and relationships to the doctor and to each other. The clinic is part of their routine. So is the street. The contrasts are sharp: care and crisis, affection and fear, routine and risk. The chapter sets that rhythm right away.

The building itself matters. The old Portland Hotel had once been elegant, then decayed. After a fire on the roof, a newspaper ran a piece about a “Hero Cop” saving a tenant’s cat. Someone later called to complain that animals should not live in those conditions. That tells you a lot about public attitudes toward the people who lived there. The new Portland is a concrete and glass structure designed by Arthur Erickson. It is clean, functional, and built to be a base for care. The Portland Hotel Society (PHS) runs it, along with several other nearby buildings. The goal is simple and very hard in practice: give people who have been pushed out of every other place a stable home. The neighborhood around the hotel has changed over decades. The Army and Navy store across the street used to draw shoppers from all over. It no longer does. The area became the hub of open drug use and street dealing. Plans for the 2010 Olympics were already bringing talk of redevelopment and pressure on residents. People feared displacement even before new buildings went up.

The PHS approach is to accept people exactly as they are, not as they might be if they met outside expectations. There is no moral test. There is housing first, then practical support. Staff help with hygiene, cleaning, and food. Nurses and the clinic team dispense methadone, HIV medicine, and psychiatric drugs, and they escort people to tests and specialist visits when they can. Mobile labs come through to draw blood for HIV and hepatitis screening. There are small groups for writing and art. An acupuncturist visits. There are movie nights, haircuts, and, when there was funding, camping trips away from the city for a brief reset. The society helped start a neighborhood bank, a gallery for local artists, a hospital ward for IV antibiotics, a supervised injection site, a free dental clinic, and the author’s clinic. At a talent night a resident took the microphone and said the Portland was the only home he had ever had. That line becomes the chapter’s theme. For many, a real home never existed before this.

The work is meaningful and draining. Many residents distrust institutions and avoid hospitals even when they are very sick. The author gives examples. Kai has a hip infection that could cripple him, but he still prioritizes his next shot of cocaine or heroin. Hobo has a bone infection in his chest that could spread to his lungs, yet he keeps using. Nick, whose father told him he was worthless, cries and explains he takes drugs so he does not feel what he feels when he is sober. The clinic is constantly cleaning. Hallways and the elevator are washed often because people bleed from injections, fights, and skin picking. One man claws at imaginary insects during cocaine paranoia. Real infestations are common. Bedbugs, lice, scabies, mice, and cockroaches are part of daily life. People sometimes describe mice as helpful because they eat cockroaches and bedbugs, up to a point. The details are plain and uncomfortable. The point is to show the full load people carry on their bodies and minds, and how hard it is to make health choices when relief is minutes away with a pipe or a syringe.

Death is not rare here. The author is frank about it. He finds Marcia dead in a room a half block from the Portland. Her eyes are open and her muscles already stiff. Syringes crack under his shoes. She did not overdose. She died in withdrawal, which can be lethal. She had just been in his office days earlier. He tells the story without theatrics because that is how it happens. Frank chooses to die in his own bed rather than in a hospital and writes a poem titled “Downtown Hellbound Train.” It is about himself and also about the murdered women tied to the Pickton farm case. The author explains that for most residents, care feels like palliative medicine. They do not expect cures. People die from HIV and hepatitis complications, sepsis after long cocaine runs, cancers that aggressive immune problems cannot hold back, and overdoses that come out of nowhere. He tells of Leona, who wakes to find her son dead in her bed after an overdose, and her grief that follows. These are not exceptions. They are ongoing facts of the clinic’s work.

The chapter also tracks pain that medicine does not treat well. The author quotes a social scientist on the contempt that many hold for the poor, sex workers, people who use drugs, and Indigenous people. You can see the effect when residents ride the bus in worn clothes and other riders shift away in silence. The author leaves the neighborhood, hears light radio chatter in the car, and feels the clash. He then recounts a patient story from the morning. Madeleine arrives crying, with a cut lip and bruises on her face. She explains that three women she knew handed her a counterfeit hundred-dollar bill and told her to buy crack from a dealer. The dealer assaulted her when he realized the bill was fake. She has been off methadone for a week and asks for help but refuses to ask anyone on the street because help there creates debts that are hard and violent. She says if she ever fights back she might kill someone and never be free again. The doctor writes her methadone script and suggests she return after her dose, but he admits she will likely not come back that day. The pull of the next hit is stronger.

Another patient, Stan, shows a different part of the trap. He is an Indigenous man, just out of jail, newly on methadone. He looks across to people on the sidewalk and says they are stuck. For many, daily life happens within a few blocks around Main and Hastings. They do not leave because the rest of the city feels hostile and confusing. On the bus, Stan feels marked. People move away or refuse to meet his eyes. He says he does not feel right until he is back in the Downtown Eastside. Ten days later he is still sleeping outside. The author recalls a story about a prisoner who escaped a Soviet camp, starved, and voluntarily returned. It is a way to explain why someone might leave and then turn back to what is familiar. 

He then turns to his own background. He was a Jewish infant in Nazi Budapest. That history informs his urgency to serve people who did not choose their suffering: he learned early that danger can arrive without warning and that whole groups can be targeted for reasons they did not choose. That early imprint helps explain why he feels driven to work with people who live with addiction, illness, and poverty. He sees their pain as real and undeserved. The same history also shapes his reactions at the clinic. When a patient misses an appointment, lies about using, or refuses treatment, he hears a hard inner voice that wants control. He catches himself using a sharp professional tone, feeling anger at the mess, or blaming people for chaos they did not create alone. He then notices his own patterns. He works too much, seeks approval, and sometimes treats loved ones with impatience when he feels powerless. Later he will describe compulsive buying of music as another way he tries to soothe himself. These observations reduce the feeling that he is fundamentally different from his patients. They point to a shared human tendency to reach for relief when distress rises, even if the method looks different from the outside.

The chapter asks why helpers come and stay. Motives are mixed. Some want to help, some want to resolve their own pain, some are drawn by the challenge, some by the closeness to addiction in their own lives. Liz Evans, a leader of the PHS, says she arrived as a nurse thinking skills would be enough. She learned quickly that she could not rescue people and that the most honest act was to sit with someone in pain. She gives an example of Julie, who was starved and beaten by a foster family and now uses multiple substances and works on the street. After being raped, Julie crawled into Liz’s lap and sobbed that it was her fault. Liz describes the intensity of that moment and the need to keep her own issues from becoming barriers. Kerstin, another leader, says the work now is about showing up, advocating, and allowing people to be who they are, while knowing the limits of what staff can change. That clarity keeps her there.

A key thread is authenticity. People in the neighborhood often lack the social mask that many use elsewhere. They lie and manipulate, but they also state their position bluntly. A patient who tries and fails to get morphine shrugs and says, with a crooked smile, that he is an addict. There is a strange relief in not pretending. The Portland nurse, Kim, says this allows her to be the same person at work and outside. She does not have to play a role. Another nurse at the supervised injection site notes how people care for each other. They share food and clothes. They give updates on friends who are sick. Community is messy here, but it is present in ways that can be rare in other parts of the city. The rawness cuts both ways. There are fights and exploitation. There are also small acts of care that keep people connected when everything else falls away.

Humor shows up often and cuts tension. A resident sings “Doctor, doctor, gimme the news,” and the author sings a line back without even turning to look, because it is a routine between them. Laura, an Indigenous woman living with HIV and a hard life, jokes at a crosswalk that the light changed because “white man says go,” and both laugh. Tony, wasted by AIDS, jokes he used to bench press two hundred pounds and now cannot lift his own body. People notice small things together, like a flower that a resident points out to staff. The chapter ends on a plain statement about presence. Patients look for the real person behind the doctor’s role. They sense right away whether he is actually with them or trying to move them along. They want care that feels human, not procedural. The author says the Downtown Eastside, with all its illness and crime and grief, still offers something many places do not. It offers a clear view of what is real, and a mirror that shows fear, pain, and longing that belong to everyone, not only to people outside the clinic door.
