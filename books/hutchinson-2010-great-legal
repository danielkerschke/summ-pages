# Hutchinson, A. C. (2010). Is eating people wrong?: Great legal cases and how they shaped the world (Vol. 1). Cambridge University Press.

Hutchinson opens by disarming the idea that law is a sealed temple of propositions. He says the best way to grasp law is to watch it move through real people in real disputes. The book follows a handful of “great cases,” not because they are perfect pieces of logic, but because lawyers and judges treat them like beacons that many later decisions steer by. The tone is welcoming on purpose, since the aim is to show law as a slice of everyday social life rather than a secret code. These cases are chosen to make that living quality visible. 
-- I've actually noticed the law is really very arbitrary. As [[ Ronald Coase ]] knew, you can't put everything in a contract. You need human beings who understand the spirit of the law to adjudicate.

To follow what he is doing, you first need a working picture of the common law. Common law means judge-made law. Courts decide a dispute, give reasons, and those reasons become a permanent part of the law that later judges are supposed to consider and usually follow. That habit is called stare decisis, which just means stand by decided things. Legislation, which comes from parliaments or congresses, can override judge-made rules, but much of daily legal life still runs on the tracks laid by past court decisions. This mix of history, habit, and reason is the method the book wants you to see from the inside. Think of legal history as a chain novel, where each new chapter must read the earlier chapters and continue the plot without breaking the story’s sense. Judges have tools to keep faith with what came before, yet they still have room to shape the next chapter. That is why Hutchinson calls judges “craftspeople” whose work is dynamic, messy, and always in progress, because society itself keeps moving. The law is an activity and a practice first, and only second a pile of rules.
-- I think you could see this in computational terms. Good lawyers have looked long and hard at this problem, so we'll just go with what they concluded. It's unlikely that we'd be able to do better. This is especially the case when higher courts (or even the Supreme Court) are involved. Actually, the decisions of higher courts are always binding, because of the principle of precedent, sometimes called *stare decisis* (Latin for “to stand by things decided”). In a legal system with multiple levels of courts, the higher courts set the authoritative interpretation of the law. Once a higher court decides how a rule should be understood or applied, all lower courts must follow that reasoning in similar cases. This keeps the law consistent across the country, so you don’t end up with different answers to the same legal question depending on which judge you happen to get. 
  
So what makes a “great case.” Not magic, and not a universal formula. A case becomes great because the legal community treats it as a lighthouse worth steering by for a time. Later, that light can dim if public values or facts on the ground change. Hutchinson prefers the lighthouse picture over “fixed stars,” since even stars explode, and legal guidance is always relative to context and audience. Greatness is earned, contested, and sometimes lost. 

Chapter 2 is the book’s title case. In 1884 a small yacht, the Mignonette, sank far from land. Four survivors reached a dinghy with almost no food or water. After weeks drifting, with the youngest, Parker, near death and arguably incapable of consent, the two senior sailors, Dudley and Stephens, killed him and the crew then fed on his body. They were rescued days later, charged with murder in England, and tried on a carefully framed “special verdict” that put the moral question squarely to the judges. The judges convicted them of murder and rejected necessity as a defense to intentional killing, because allowing a survival-of-the-fittest rule in court would turn law into raw appetite. The Lord Chief Justice called it a “temptation to murder” that law must not bless. The Crown then commuted the sentence to six months, which is important context, because it shows a legal line held at trial with clemency added later by the political branch. That split between legal rule and later mercy is part of the lesson. Emergencies are real, yet if you turn necessity into a general license to pick victims, the law stops protecting the weakest exactly when they most need it. Hutchinson’s point is that **bright lines can be morally clumsy and still worth upholding**. Courts can keep the line against killing, and sympathetic elected officials can soften outcomes afterward, which keeps the rule clear without ignoring human tragedy

Chapter 3 moves to mid-century Quebec and the rule of law. Frank Roncarelli ran a restaurant in Montreal. He also posted bail for many Jehovah’s Witnesses who were being arrested in a political clampdown. The Premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis, personally ordered the provincial liquor board to revoke Roncarelli’s liquor license permanently, not for any liquor violation, but to punish him for his lawful support of unpopular defendants. That is raw political power crossing into legal punishment. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled for Roncarelli. It awarded damages against Duplessis himself, holding that even very powerful officials are under law, not above it, and they cannot use public powers for private political ends. The court did not bless the Witnesses’ beliefs; it enforced the idea that legal powers have legal purposes. The case is a working picture of the rule of law: reasons, limits, and accountability that bind governments when they are tempted to strike back. 

**Chapter 4** changes gears to the law of property by asking a simple question that becomes surprisingly intricate: When do you own a wild thing you are chasing? **When does something that belongs to no one become yours in a way that everyone else should respect?** Wild animals are a clean way to see the problem, because before anyone catches them they are unowned, and yet many people may be trying to catch the same creature at the same time. In Pierson v. Post, one hunter had been chasing a fox for a while, doing the tiring part of the work, when another person stepped in and killed the fox first. The court had to pick a rule that strangers could use without knowing each other’s plans. It chose a bright, practical line. Mere pursuit does not give you a legal claim, because no one else can easily verify how close you were or how long you had chased. Ownership begins when you have actual control, like capture, or when the animal has been mortally wounded so escape is no longer realistic. This favors actions that outsiders can see and agree on at a glance, which reduces fights, even though it feels unfair to the person who did the initial chasing. 
-- The author then shows that this capture idea is not a one-size-fits-all command. Courts let custom fill in details where a community has stable practices that make sense for their world. Whalers, for example, could not stand guard over a sinking whale in the open sea. Their communities treated a harpoon or bomb-lance as a kind of legal placeholder, because everyone understood that a struck whale would drift before it could be hauled in. That custom turned an invisible “claim” into a visible sign other people accepted. In a modern stadium, a similar puzzle showed up when Barry Bonds hit a record home-run ball. One fan got the ball into his glove but a surge of bodies knocked it loose and another fan ended up holding it. Because no one could finish a clean catch in that chaos, the court recognized that the first fan had started to gain possession but was stopped by crowd interference, and it split the value between the two men. Put together, these examples teach a general lesson. Property rules are tools for coordinating strangers who need to share space and resources without constant fighting. The goal is not to reward virtue in the abstract, but to pick signals that real people can notice and follow. Courts start with simple rules like “capture counts,” and then they tune those rules when a settled custom or special setting makes a different signal more reliable and fair.

Chapter 5 is Brown v. Board of Education, the school segregation case. After the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment promised equal protection of the laws, but in 1896 the Supreme Court decided Plessy v. Ferguson, which allowed “separate but equal” public facilities. In practice, separate almost always meant inferior for Black Americans, especially in schools. Linda Brown was a third-grader in Topeka, Kansas. She lived near a white school called Sumner but had to cross a rail yard or take a bus to a farther Black school because the local district separated students by race. The NAACP, which was a civil rights legal organization, chose her case as part of a careful plan to challenge the old rule. Their strategy was to show not only that buildings and books were different, but that the very act of separating children by race stamped a badge of inferiority on one group and harmed their development. A three-judge federal court agreed there was harm but felt tied to Plessy, so it said the facilities were roughly comparable and kept segregation in place. That set the stage for an appeal to the Supreme Court. 
-- The justices asked for the case to be argued again, partly so they could work toward a single, united answer. The new Chief Justice, Earl Warren, understood that a divided Court would invite resistance, so he pushed for a short opinion in everyday language that parents and school boards could read without a law degree. The Court said that separate schools are inherently unequal under the Fourteenth Amendment, because the separation itself damages children and denies them equal protection, and it drew support from the trial record and social science studies that documented those effects. That was the constitutional holding. The next year, in what people call Brown II, the Court faced the practical question of how to change thousands of school systems. It told districts to desegregate “with all deliberate speed.” Those words were meant to be firm but workable. In reality, they left room for delay. Some places moved quickly. Many did not. Officials invented plans that looked compliant on paper but preserved old patterns in practice, and it often took more court orders, new laws, and sometimes federal marshals to turn the principle into daily life. Brown shows both the power and the limits of a landmark decision. A clear rule at the top can reset the law, yet changing routines on the ground still requires a long, patient push through local politics, school boards, budgets, and human habits.

Chapter 6 begins in Paisley, Scotland. May Donoghue is out late at the Wellmeadow Café with a friend who buys her a ginger-beer float. The bottle is opaque. After a few sips, a brown object slides out of the bottle. It is a decomposed snail. Donoghue feels ill and later sues the manufacturer, Mr. Stevenson, even though she has no contract with him because she was not the buyer. A local lawyer, Walter Leechman, helps her bring the claim. So this is not a story about a lady and a snail so much as a story about how law adjusts when there is harm but no formal obligation between the people involved. The House of Lords splits 3–2. Lord Atkin writes a line that students memorize: you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your “neighbors.” Neighbors here does not mean next-door residents. It means people who are closely and directly affected by what you do, such that you ought reasonably to have them in mind when you act. That move dissolves the old barrier that said “no contract, no duty” and replaces it with a general duty of care whenever harm is a foreseeable result of your activity.
-- The author also stresses style and story here. Donoghue became great partly because Atkin wrote like a preacher and a reformer, drawing on the Good Samaritan image to make the moral logic feel familiar. The case shows something the book returns to at the end: clear writing and forceful framing help a judgment travel far, because law grows not just by logic, but by persuasion that catches on with the larger legal community.

Chapter 7 takes place in the Torres Strait, north of Australia, and Mer, or Murray Island. Eddie Koiki Mabo grows up in a Meriam community with its own rules and stories about land. Those rules are often called Malo’s Law. The basic idea, in simple terms, is that land on Mer is held by families with responsibilities and boundaries recognized by custom. Mabo later becomes an activist and, with others, challenges the old colonial legal doctrine that had treated Australia as “terra nullius,” a land that belonged to no one in a way English law would recognize. Queensland’s parliament tries to shut down the claim with the Queensland Coast Islands Declaratory Act 1985, which aims to erase any native rights in those islands. The High Court of Australia in Mabo (No 1) knocks that Act out because it conflicts with the federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975. That ruling keeps the case alive and clears room for the bigger question: does Australian common law recognize native title at all? 
-- Mabo (No 2) is the landmark case. In 1992 the High Court recognizes that native title can exist where Indigenous peoples had their own laws and customs and a continuing connection to land, and that British sovereignty did not automatically wipe this out. The court rejects the fiction of terra nullius and, for Mer in particular, affirms that Meriam law and its landholding system mattered in a way Australian law must now respect. In doing so, the court even endorses the substance of Malo’s Law for that place. After the decision, parliament passes the Native Title Act 1993 to set procedures for recognizing and dealing with native title. A few years later, the Wik case decides that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native title, which means native title can coexist with other interests on the same land unless there is a direct conflict. The legal path is messy and political, but the core point is clear: Mabo relocated the starting assumption about Australia’s legal map, from denial to possible recognition, case by case.

Chapter 8 turns to contracts and a very industrial problem. The Hadley brothers run the City Flour Mills in Gloucester. A crankshaft breaks. To fix the mill they must send the broken shaft to a manufacturer through a carrier, Pickford & Co. The delivery is delayed. The mill stays idle longer. The Hadleys sue for lost profits. On first hearing they win, but on appeal the judges say these lost profits are not automatically payable. The result becomes the backbone of modern rules on “remoteness” of damages in contract. 
-- In other words, when someone breaks a contract, they must pay for the losses that would normally be expected from that breach, but if there are unusual or extra losses, they only have to pay for those if both sides knew about the special circumstances when they made the deal. For example, if a delivery company is late bringing you a machine, they owe you for the delay itself, but if you told them ahead of time that the machine was for a one-day trade show, and they still agreed, then they could also be responsible for the bigger profit loss due to missing the show.
-- This “two-limb” structure is why businesses try to share information clearly when it matters, or, on the flipside, to limit liability in writing. If you know downtime will cost you a fortune, you must say so before the deal, not after the breach. Courts then treat the big loss as part of the known risk that the other side accepted. Without that notice, the law gives you the ordinary, expected loss, not the unusual one, because the deal never included that hidden risk.

Chapter 9 moves to criminal procedure and reads like a true-crime file. In March 1963, in Phoenix, eighteen-year-old Lois Ann Jameson is abducted after work. A suspect, Ernesto Arturo Miranda, is arrested. Police run a poor lineup. They question him for about two hours in a small room. He confesses and signs a typed form above a printed “warning” that does not actually tell him he has a right to remain silent or a right to a lawyer. At trial the confession is the state’s strongest card, and he is convicted. On appeal in Arizona he loses. The ACLU then spots the case and brings in serious appellate firepower. At the U.S. Supreme Court, John Flynn argues for Miranda. Thurgood Marshall appears for the federal government in a narrower role. Arizona’s lawyer insists stronger limits will cripple real-world policing. In June 1966 the Court splits 5–4. Chief Justice Earl Warren writes a long opinion that sets out a clear set of pre-interrogation warnings for custodial questioning. Before questioning, a suspect must be told the right to remain silent, that anything said can be used in court, the right to consult a lawyer and have the lawyer present, and that if the suspect cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided. This is the origin of what patrol officers still recite on countless sidewalks and in countless stations.
-- The dissenting justices are worried about hindering the police too much. Justice Clark favors a “totality of circumstances” test over rigid rules. Justice Harlan argues the majority has gone too far too fast with no clear textual basis. Congress later tries to pull the decision back for federal cases, but in 2000 the Supreme Court reaffirms Miranda in Dickerson. After that, lower courts spend decades drawing the boundaries. They decide when custody and interrogation begin, how precise the words must be, how a waiver works, and how other evidence is treated if a confession is excluded. The book walks through those key forks so you see the living rule, not just the famous paragraph.

The closing chapter, “Coming Up for Air,” steps back from the cases and again asks what common law really is. Common law is the part of law that grows case by case through judges’ decisions, rather than being written all at once in a code, so you can picture it like a long story that many authors write in sequence: each judge reads the earlier chapters and then adds a new one that fits what came before and keeps the plot workable in real life. Because of that, the most famous cases are not perfect, eternal answers; they are more like lighthouses that help ships for a time from a particular shore, built with the tools and needs of that moment, and later replaced when the currents and traffic change. Outcomes are also shaped by ordinary forces that sit around the ideals: which facts the court believes based on how evidence is presented, what the institutions involved can actually do, who has the money and time to litigate, and even timing and luck, such as which panel of judges hears the appeal. Seeing these influences is not cynical; it reminds us that law is a human craft that blends clear principles with judgment under pressure. From this angle, famous decisions illustrate how the craft works within its era: Brown v. Board shows how courts can push toward equality, Mabo shows recognition of Indigenous land rights in its context, Miranda shows a compromise that adds police warnings but leaves many gray areas, and Hadley v. Baxendale sets a boundary by saying you pay for losses that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract, which means losses a sensible person could predict given what both sides knew then. The thread through all of this is that common law does not leap by revelation but moves by careful revision, and it stays useful because judges keep weaving stable rules together with practical sense as new cases, new facts, and new social needs arrive.
