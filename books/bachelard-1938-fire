Bachelard, G. (1987). The psychoanalysis of fire (A. C. M. Ross, Trans.). [Publisher]. (Original work published 1938).

Bachelard’s book asks a very basic question: what happens in our minds when we look at fire, talk about fire, and build ideas around fire. He shows that fire is not only a thing that burns wood. It also tends to stir the same old feelings, stories, and habits of thought. Because of that, even smart people mix daydreams with facts when they think about fire. He wants us to see this mixture clearly. His goal is to cure our minds of first impressions, warm fantasies, and hand-me-down sayings, so that we notice how fascination can mislead us. (This is the larger point of the book.) Art begins in imagination, and fire quickly links by analogy to warmth, life, passion, cleansing, and punishment. Because these links are sticky, they spread everywhere in culture. Bachelard maps those links, not to mock them, but to separate our reverie from our reasoning. Once we see how deep the reverie runs, we can enjoy poetry more honestly and do science more soberly.

Bachelard is not teaching the physics of fire. He is studying how fire lives in our heads and hearts, and how those feelings can bend our thinking without us noticing. He begins with something ordinary. When we look at flames, our first reaction is wonder, and that first reaction is so strong that it can push us toward quick beliefs that feel right. If we want to be objective, which means trying to see things as they are rather than how we wish them to be, we have to pause, steady ourselves, and check those beliefs. By calling his work a psychoanalysis of fire, he means a careful look at the hidden images, memories, and private stories that cling to fire, for example the comfort of a hearth, the thrill of a candle, or the fear of getting burned, and he shows how these attachments can quietly block clear reasoning. He also keeps a boundary in view. Poetry leans into imagination and welcomes the feelings that flames awaken. Science trains itself to keep a respectful distance, to question, and to compare what we think with what we can test. His book stands at that boundary, asking how to enjoy the riches of imagination while protecting the discipline of careful inquiry, since both impulses keep pulling on each other. (I think this means that he wants to rigorously study how people feel about fire, which -- once upon a time -- was a guiding impulse of psychoanalysis, see [[ malcolm-1982-psychoanalysis ]]. The book also has some advice about not letting these subconscious images distort our perception, which apparently has happened in the scientific study of fire; its sheer drama led people to be reckless in attributing significance to it. The book was meant as a guide to thinking in general.)

He begins by explaining why fire is such a “privileged” image for humans. Fire feels alive. It cooks our food and can destroy our cities. It warms our hands and burns our skin. It glows in ideas of heaven and roars in images of hell. Because fire seems to hold both good and evil at once, people have long used it to explain anything that changes quickly. That is why talk about fire in old medical or philosophical writing often sounds powerful but vague. It is loaded with value words, not measurements. Bachelard quotes a doctor praising a “gentle, aromatic” fire that somehow polishes the body from within, and he points out that nothing in that sentence has a clear testable meaning. That is his point. We are convinced by fire-talk, without wanting a clear definition, because fire already carries our strongest feelings (whatever they may be, since it can be interpreted in so many ways).

From there he asks how we first learn to “respect” fire. His answer is practical. As children, we do not start with a scientific lesson. We start with a social rule. Do not touch. Parents teach that rule by warnings and sometimes by a smack on the knuckles. So before we feel a burn, we have already learned that fire is forbidden. When a child finally seeks a private, hands-on lesson, it often happens in secret. The child steals matches, builds a hidden little hearth with friends, and learns by disobedience. Bachelard calls this the “Prometheus complex.” The core idea is a will to know with your own hands and to match or surpass your elders. It is a hunger for intellectual independence, knowing for sure rather than being told, that tends to use fire as its testing ground.

He then turns to the simple experience of staring into a fire. You are awake. Your mind drifts, but it stays with the fire. In psychoanalysis this kind of waking drift is called a *reverie*, which means a calm daydream that keeps returning to the thing you are looking at. A normal dream during sleep tends to run away from its starting point and forget it, but a reverie keeps circling back to the flames. You hear the crackling, you see the shapes shift and rise, and the fire looks like change that you can actually see happening. Watching this can make you think about time moving faster, about things coming to an end, and also about new beginnings that can follow after burning. Bachelard gives this feeling a name: the Empedocles complex. Empedocles was an ancient Greek thinker, and a legend says he jumped into a volcano. Writers often try to capture this mood. Bachelard mentions a traveler near Mount Etna, which is a real volcano in Sicily, who longs to be wrapped in lava, and he explains why such scenes feel powerful to us. A funeral pyre, which is a stack of wood used to burn a dead body, gives a human picture of an ending that also suggests a beginning, because the fire both finishes a life and clears the way for whatever comes next. In this way, your quiet daydream at the hearth grows in your mind to the size of a volcano and then returns to the small fire again, so one log in your fireplace feels connected to the larger forces of the world.
-- Bachelard brings this up to show a feeling people sometimes have when they stare at fire. The feeling is a strange pull toward the fire, as if the fire could both end things and clean them so something new can begin. Mount Etna is a real volcano in Sicily, which is an island off the coast of Italy. Bachelard mentions a traveler near Etna who imagines being wrapped in lava, not because this is wise or safe, but because lava is the giant, outdoor version of the little fire in a hearth. It scares you and attracts you at the same time. Writers use scenes like this to capture that mixed feeling of fear, surrender, and hope for renewal that fire often brings to the human mind.

Next he looks backward to prehistory and asks how people first imagined making fire. He doubts neat rational stories like “someone saw branches rub in a storm and copied the trick.” He says that is our modern projection. In reality, he thinks people first felt inner heat, shared heat, and rhythmic effort, then connected that bodily sense to wood-on-wood friction. (Sure.) He names this the “Novalis complex,” after the Romantic writer who loved images of inner warmth, mines, and the “innate heat” of the earth. The key for Bachelard is that science usually starts as a daydream that gives direction, then experiments slowly correct the dream. We can only study well what we first learned to imagine. Fire-making by friction, in this view, grew out of intimate, rhythmical experience that felt warming and purposeful before it was a method.

He does not deny the sexual coloring around many fire images, but he is careful about where he uses it. He notes that psychiatry links fire-setting to sexual drive, and that classic psychoanalysis reads fire dreams that way. For his own purpose, he often stays at a shallower layer, closer to everyday thought. He shows how sexual tones are present in our fantasies around fire, then places those tones alongside other drives like curiosity, skill, and the wish to understand. This helps him keep different “complexes” separate. Not every fire image is simply sexual. Some mark respect and defiance, some mark reverie and death, some mark warmth and shared intimacy. That variety is the point of his method regarding fire. 
-- This is apparently psychoanalytic knowledge so basic it is not worth mentioning: Fire looks and behaves like a living thing, so our minds map body feelings onto it without effort. It wakes up, rises, needs fuel, breathes air, and throws off heat that reddens skin. It begins with friction, builds through a steady increase, flares, and then settles into a glowing afterstate. That arc resembles arousal, climax, and afterglow, so the pattern itself teaches the association. Fire also pulls people close and makes a shared circle of warmth, which feels like intimacy. Its light flatters the body, its movement is rhythmic like a dance, and it is both risky and forbidden if mishandled. (Ritual dances archetypically happen around a fire, and are often associated with sex.) Because it can create and destroy, it carries the double charge of danger and life-making, which is exactly the emotional mix that surrounds sex. Language then locks the link in place, with everyday phrases like spark, flame, and smolder making the connection feel natural. (The psychoanalysts are picking up on something real. Those phrases exist for a reason. Of course, sex feels dangerous because it pulls you toward closeness while exposing your body, status, and future to another person, inviting pregnancy, heartbreak, and irreversible change at the same time it promises pleasure and creation, like a blade that can carve or cut.)

In the end, the book sits near literature. Northrop Frye’s preface explains why. The arts build with analogy and identity, and fire is one of our strongest analogies. It ties bodily warmth, sex, growth, punishment, purity, and apocalypse into one bright knot. Bachelard’s “complexes” are a way to map that knot. Prometheus marks the defiant, knowledge-hungry fire. Empedocles marks the purifying and annihilating fire. Novalis marks the inward, prenatal, unfallen fire. With this map in hand, you can read Dante’s purgatorial flames, Romantic volcanoes, or modern myths of judgment with more precision. Science may not need these myths, but literature thrives on them, and Bachelard gives us language to track how they work.
