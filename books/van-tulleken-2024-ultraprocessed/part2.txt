"But Can't I Just Control What I Eat?"

Part 2 of the book systematically dismantles the common beliefs we hold about our ability to consciously control our diet, arguing that our bodies operate on ancient biological systems that are being exploited by modern industrial food. To set the stage, van Tulleken first introduces the "three ages of eating." The first age was life eating inorganic matter like rocks. The second, which lasted for hundreds of millions of years, is the age our bodies evolved in: eating other living things, or "real food." This is the era of hunting, gathering, and traditional agriculture. He highlights the remarkable experiments of Clara Davis in the 1920s, where infants fed a wide variety of whole foods perfectly self-regulated their nutritional intake, proving we have an innate wisdom for eating. The third and most recent age is our current one: eating ultra-processed food (UPF), a category of substances our bodies have no evolutionary experience with. This framework establishes the fundamental mismatch between our ancient biology and our modern diet.

Building on this, the author explains the sophisticated, non-conscious system our bodies use to manage calories and maintain a stable weight, which operates with the precision of a complex thermostat rather than a simple bucket we pour calories into. He describes the foundational science that revealed this internal control, highlighting the grim but revelatory "parabiotic pair" experiments conducted by G.R. Hervey in the 1950s. In these studies, two rats were surgically joined to share a single circulatory system. When one rat's hypothalamus (the brain's control center) was damaged, it lost its ability to feel full, began to eat voraciously, and became obese. The truly shocking discovery was the effect on its healthy, connected twin: it began to starve itself, wasting away because it was being flooded with powerful "stop eating" signals from the overfed rat's blood. *This proved definitively that our bodies use blood-borne signals to regulate weight.* Van Tulleken identifies one of the key signals as the hormone leptin, which is produced not by inert lard, but by our fat tissue itself—a "sophisticated endocrine organ." Leptin constantly communicates the body's long-term energy stores to the brain, creating a powerful feedback loop that adjusts hunger up or down. This long-term system works in concert with a short-term network of signals from the stomach, gut, and pancreas that monitor each meal in real time. This entire neuroendocrine system, involving a constant dialogue between our organs and our brain, operates almost entirely below the level of conscious thought, proving that our appetite and body weight are not simply matters of choice but are instead tightly regulated biological processes honed over millions of years.

-- So basically, if you're fat, your body's natural 'thermostat' for managing energy has been reset to defend a higher weight because this entire system evolved as a powerful defense against starvation, its primary directive for millennia. When it senses a threat (like dieting), it instinctively fights back by sending powerful hunger signals and reducing metabolic activity to conserve energy and maintain that new, higher set point. This system now defends obesity because the intense, artificial signals from ultra-processed food have hijacked it. However, with obesity, the fat cells are producing a huge amount of leptin. The signal is no longer a quiet message; it's a constant, deafening scream of "WE'RE FULL!" Like living next to an alarm that never turns off, the brain's receptors become overwhelmed and desensitized. To protect itself from the relentless noise, the brain effectively starts to ignore the signal, becoming "deaf" to leptin.
 So, even while living with excess energy stores, your ancient survival mechanism is convinced you're starving, making it nearly impossible to consciously 'eat less' against its powerful, primal commands.


With this biological foundation laid, van Tulleken turns to debunking the most popular dietary villain of the last two decades: sugar. He details the rise of the carbohydrate-insulin model, famously promoted by Gary Taubes, which argues that carbohydrates spike insulin, uniquely driving fat storage and hunger. However, he then presents the definitive scientific evidence that has largely disproven this theory. He focuses on the groundbreaking clinical trials by researcher Kevin Hall, which demonstrated that when calories are matched, a high-carb diet does not cause more fat gain than a low-carb diet. While sugar in UPF is a problem because it drives overconsumption and rots teeth, it is not the unique metabolic culprit it has been made out to be. The focus on sugar, he argues, has been a damaging distraction from the real problem.

The book then dismantles the second pillar of modern dietary advice: exercise. The author challenges the "you can't outrun a bad diet" cliché with the surprising science of constrained energy expenditure. Citing the work of anthropologist Herman Pontzer, he explains that highly active hunter-gatherers like the Hadza burn the same number of calories per day as sedentary Western office workers. The body compensates for energy spent on physical activity by reducing energy spent elsewhere, such as on stress and immune responses. This means that while exercise is crucial for health, it is largely ineffective for weight loss. This idea has been deliberately obscured by UPF companies like Coca-Cola, which have spent millions funding science and campaigns to promote the idea that a lack of exercise, not their products, is the cause of obesity.

Next, van Tulleken confronts the most pervasive and stigmatizing myth of all: that obesity is a failure of willpower. Using the powerful example of his identical twin brother Xand -- who has the same genes but has weighed significantly more in the past -- he illustrates that the environment is the critical factor. Our genetic predispositions for weight gain are only expressed in a "food swamp" environment saturated with cheap, heavily marketed UPF and compounded by stress. He re-examines the famous marshmallow experiment, showing that a child's ability to delay gratification is not a measure of innate willpower but is overwhelmingly predicted by their socioeconomic background (and no other single factor). Ultimately, he argues, blaming individuals for their weight is a cruel and ineffective delusion that ignores the biological and environmental forces at play.

Finally, the author reveals exactly how UPF hacks our brains and overrides these ancient regulatory systems. Drawing on his own month-long experiment of eating an 80% UPF diet, he describes the devastating results: significant weight gain, deranged hunger and fullness hormones, and, most alarmingly, measurable changes in the connectivity between the reward and impulse control centers of his brain, as seen on MRI scans. He argues that UPF should not be considered food at all, but an "industrially produced edible substance" with addictive properties. Its unique combination of softness (leading to rapid consumption), energy density, and artificial flavouring creates a physiological and neurological response that drives cravings and overconsumption, fundamentally breaking the biological systems that evolved to keep us healthy.
