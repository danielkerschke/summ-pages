Part 3 of "Ultra-Processed People," titled "Oh, so this is why I'm anxious and my belly aches!", details the specific mechanisms by which UPF harms the human body and mind.

The author begins by explaining that the fundamental problem with UPF starts with its physical structure, or "food matrix." In whole foods, nutrients are encased in a complex fibrous structure that our bodies have to work to break down. Ultra-processing, however, obliterates this matrix by grinding, pulverizing, and extruding ingredients into pastes and powders. The result is a product that is characteristically soft. This softness means the food is essentially "pre-chewed," requiring minimal effort to eat. This physical change is the first and perhaps most critical step in how UPF affects us, as it dramatically increases the speed at which we can consume it.

This unnatural softness and speed of consumption directly undermines the body's finely tuned systems for regulating hunger and fullness. Our satiety hormones, which signal to the brain that we've had enough, are released slowly as food travels through our digestive tract. Because soft, energy-dense UPF is consumed so quickly, we can easily eat hundreds of extra calories before these fullness signals even have a chance to kick in. This explains the core finding in scientific trials: people involuntarily eat more calories and gain weight on a UPF diet. The author also explores a fascinating side effect: the lack of chewing is linked to weaker, smaller jaw development in modern populations, contributing to dental problems.

Part 3 then looks into how UPF manipulates our senses, starting with smell. Our sense of smell evolved to be a sophisticated nutrient-detection system; the aroma of a ripe peach signals the presence of specific vitamins and energy. UPF severs this connection. By using industrial flavorings—whether "natural" or "artificial" -- manufacturers can create intense aromas that are disconnected from any real nutritional value. This creates a "physiological confusion," where our brain anticipates a rich source of nutrients based on the smell, but receives a nutrient-poor, calorie-dense substance instead. This mismatch can drive us to eat more, in a futile search for the nutrition our senses were promised.

The book explains that UPF also hijacks our sense of taste. Our tongues are designed to handle natural combinations of sweet, salt, fat, and sour. UPF, however, often combines these tastes at intensities never found in nature, a technique the author likens to a nutritional "speedball" (the combination of heroine and cocaine). Using flavour enhancers, extreme levels of sugar are smuggled past our palate by balancing them with high levels of salt, acid, and caffeine. It basically uses other tastes to bypass the body's natural aversion to e.g. sickly sweetness. This creates a hyper-rewarding product that bypasses our natural sensory limits, making it almost impossible to stop eating. The result is a food engineered not for nutrition, but for maximum consumption.

Moving beyond the senses, the author confronts the direct biological harm caused by specific additives, focusing on emulsifiers. These are ubiquitous molecules in UPF, used to bind oil and water to improve texture and shelf-life. Scientific evidence shows that these industrial emulsifiers can damage the protective mucus layer of our intestines. This harms our microbiome -- the vital community of gut bacteria—allowing for inflammation and causing the gut to become "leaky." This chronic, low-grade inflammation is a suspected driver of a vast range of modern illnesses, from inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders to anxiety and depression, directly linking the consumption of these substances to the physical and mental distress described in the part's title.

Throughout this section, the scientific explanations are woven into the author's increasingly grim personal experience on his 80% UPF diet. He describes a noticeable decline in his physical and mental health, suffering from anxiety dreams, constipation, piles, low energy, and irritability. Most profoundly, he explains the psychological shift where the food became less enjoyable but paradoxically more desirable, a hallmark of addictive substances. He fully grasps the idea that what he is eating isn't truly "food" in the traditional sense, but rather, as one expert tells him, an "industrially produced edible substance" designed for profit, with his own health being an irrelevant externality.
