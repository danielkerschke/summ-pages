Part 4, titled "But I Already Paid for This!", explains the systemic, and often hidden, costs of ultra-processed food (UPF). It argues that the price you pay at the checkout is just the beginning. The real costs are externalized onto society in the form of failed regulation, legal battles funded by taxpayers, environmental destruction, and future public health crises. This section reveals how the entire system is structured to protect corporate profit at the expense of public well-being.

The section opens by exposing the shocking failures of the regulatory bodies that are supposed to keep food safe, focusing on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Van Tulleken explains the "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) loophole, a system originally meant for common ingredients like vinegar. He reveals how it has become a primary pathway for companies to introduce thousands of new chemical additives into the food supply with virtually no independent oversight. Companies can hire their own experts to declare an ingredient safe, and if the FDA raises concerns, they can simply withdraw their application and sell the product anyway through a process of "self-determination," sometimes without ever informing the FDA at all.

-- This seems like an exaggeration, particularly since I have heard very different things about the FDA, with rationalists usually portraying it as a pathologically careful, obstructionist organisation.

This "dysregulatory" environment has profound consequences. It means that the vast majority of new chemicals in our food have not undergone rigorous, independent, long-term safety testing, especially for their cumulative effects or their impact on children. The author highlights that even entire industries, like the flavor industry, essentially regulate themselves, creating their own panels to approve substances. This explains how so many additives discussed in the previous section—emulsifiers, synthetic flavorings, and novel chemicals—are able to enter the food chain despite a lack of data on their long-term health impacts, leaving the public to act as unwitting test subjects.

Beyond regulatory failures, this part details the social and cultural costs of UPF. Using the powerful example of Nestlé's marketing in remote parts of the Brazilian Amazon, the book illustrates how UPF companies deliberately displace traditional, sustainable food cultures. This is not a passive process but an aggressive strategy that introduces "commerciogenic malnutrition" -- a situation where communities suffer from obesity and diet-related diseases like type 2 diabetes for the first time. The global spread of UPF is presented as a form of violence that erodes local economies, health, and cultural identity.

The title "But I Already Paid for This!" is also explored in a very literal, financial sense. Using the fascinating legal battle over whether Pringles are legally "potato crisps" for tax purposes, van Tulleken shows how we pay for UPF multiple times. We pay when we buy the product, we pay through our taxes which fund the government's legal teams to fight these corporations, and we pay again through the effective public subsidy these companies receive when they successfully avoid taxes. This constant legal maneuvering is framed as another form of ultra-processing, where legal and financial systems are manipulated to maximize profit.

-- I don't know about that.

Finally, the section culminates by outlining the largest hidden costs of all: the catastrophic environmental and public health damage. The production of UPF is inextricably linked to the most destructive aspects of the modern food system. This includes deforestation for palm oil and soy plantations, the enormous carbon footprint of industrial agriculture, the looming crisis of antibiotic resistance driven by factory farming (which supplies cheap meat for UPF), and the overwhelming plastic pollution from its packaging. These externalized costs are not reflected in the price of the food but are paid for by everyone through a damaged planet and a strained healthcare system.
