"Wait, I'm Eating What?"

Part one begins with a simple observation that serves as the book's catalyst: the author, Chris van Tulleken, notices his young daughter's ice cream isn't melting on a hot day. This peculiar event sparks his journey into understanding what is really in our food. Instead of a puddle, the ice cream remains a "tepid gelatinous foam." An online search of the ingredients reveals a list of unfamiliar industrial substances like gums, emulsifiers, and stabilisers. This personal and relatable anecdote immediately frames the central question of the section: What are these strange ingredients doing in our food, and why are they there? It transforms a common treat into a subject of scientific mystery, prompting the reader to look at their own food with new suspicion.

To understand the non-melting ice cream, van Tulleken consults a food industry insider, Paul Hart. Hart explains that the purpose of these additives is not nutrition but logistics and profit. Emulsifiers and gums make ice cream tolerant to temperature changes, allowing it to be shipped long distances and moved from factory to freezer without forming unpleasant ice crystals. This enables massive, centralized production, which drastically cuts costs. The conversation reveals that the primary driver for creating Ultra-Processed Food (UPF) is to re-engineer food to withstand the rigours of a long supply chain, extend shelf life indefinitely, and replace expensive natural ingredients with cheaper industrial alternatives, thereby maximizing profit.

The book describes the fundamental nature of UPF, explaining it as the product of deconstruction and reconstruction. Traditional food is broken down into its basic molecular components -- carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. These components are then sourced from the cheapest possible crops (like corn, wheat, and soy), heavily refined, and chemically modified into powders and slurries. Using the history of margarine as a prime example—from its origins as chemically treated animal suet to the hydrogenation of cheap vegetable oils—the author shows how industry has perfected the art of creating synthetic, food-like substances. These base ingredients, often unpalatable on their own, are then reassembled with a host of additives to create the final product, which mimics real food but is fundamentally an industrial concoction.

Van Tulleken introduces the scientific framework for understanding this new category of food: the NOVA classification system, developed by Brazilian scientist Carlos Monteiro. This system divides food into four groups based on the extent and purpose of processing. While groups 1-3 cover unprocessed foods, culinary ingredients, and traditionally processed foods (like cheese or canned beans), Group 4 defines "ultra-processed foods." The key distinction is that UPF are "formulations of ingredients," mostly of exclusive industrial use, designed to be hyper-palatable, convenient, and highly profitable. This definition moves beyond simply counting calories, fat, or sugar and focuses instead on the industrial processes and economic purpose that fundamentally change the nature of what we eat.

Having defined UPF, the book addresses the crucial question: Is it actually a problem? The author presents compelling evidence, starting with a landmark study by Kevin Hall. In this controlled trial, people on a UPF diet ate 500 more calories per day and gained weight compared to those on an unprocessed diet, even though the two diets were perfectly matched for salt, sugar, fat, and fibre. The book then broadens this to show a deluge of epidemiological research linking high UPF consumption to increased risks of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, depression, and even dementia. Crucially, these studies show that the harm persists even after accounting for the food's nutrient content, suggesting the problem lies within the processing itself.
