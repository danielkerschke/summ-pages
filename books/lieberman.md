title: "The Story of the Human Body"
---

This book begins with a puzzle. We live in paradoxical times for our bodies. On one hand, this is likely the healthiest era in human history. In many parts of the world, diseases that once killed in droves—smallpox, the plague, polio—have been conquered or quelled. We can reasonably expect our children to survive to adulthood, and for us to live into our dotage. Formerly life-threatening conditions like a broken leg or appendicitis are now easily remedied. Yet, on the other hand, we could be doing much better. A wave of chronic, preventable illnesses is sweeping the globe. These are not the ancient infectious scourges, but modern ailments: type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, osteoporosis, but also a host of less deadly but debilitating troubles like lower back pain, anxiety, and myopia. These aren't just diseases of old age; they are increasingly appearing in middle-aged people. How can our time be both a golden age for health and a burgeoning crisis of chronic disease?

The author, a professor of human evolutionary biology, argues that this paradox stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of our own bodies. The key lies in an idea best illustrated by a story from the source text: the "Mystery Monkey" of Tampa, Florida. This macaque lived for years on city streets, evading capture. While most people saw it as an animal out of place, an anomaly in a suburban environment, they rarely apply the same logic to themselves. From an evolutionary perspective, a human living in a modern city, surrounded by cars, processed food, and air-conditioning, is just as far removed from their ancestral environment as that monkey. Our bodies, the product of millions of years of evolution in environments of scarcity and physical hardship, are now operating in a world of unprecedented abundance and comfort. This profound mismatch between our ancient biology and our modern lives is the engine driving the chronic diseases that plague us.

This naturally leads to the question at the heart of the book: *What are human bodies adapted for?* The answer is more complex and less intuitive than it first appears. It’s tempting to think of adaptation in terms of perfection or optimality for a specific lifestyle, like that of a Stone Age hunter-gatherer. This logic fuels trends like the "paleodiet." But this view misunderstands what adaptation means in biology. Natural selection does not shape organisms to be healthy, long-lived, or happy. It shapes them for one primary purpose: reproductive success. Adaptations are simply heritable traits that, in a particular environment, helped an individual’s ancestors have more surviving offspring than their competitors. A craving for sugar and fat was a superb adaptation when calories were scarce and starvation was a constant threat; it helped our ancestors store energy and survive to reproduce. In a modern supermarket, that same inherited craving becomes a direct path to obesity and diabetes. The adaptation itself is not "good" or "bad"; its value is entirely dependent on the context.

Furthermore, the human body is not a perfectly engineered machine, but a palimpsest—an old manuscript page written on over and over again. Each stage of our evolutionary history has layered new adaptations on top of older ones, creating a jumble of compromises. Our teeth, inherited from fruit-eating ape ancestors, are superb for chewing figs but terrible for gnawing raw meat. Our upright posture, which freed our hands, also gave us weak lower backs prone to aching. There was no single environment for which the human body is "optimally" designed. To understand what we are adapted for is to understand this entire, messy history, not just a snapshot from the late Stone Age. The author suggests this history can be understood through a series of major transformations, which function as the book's narrative spine.

The book charts this history through five major biological transitions. It begins with the first human ancestors diverging from apes and evolving to be upright bipeds. This was followed by the evolution of the australopiths, who developed adaptations to eat a much wider range of foods beyond fruit. About two million years ago, the first members of our own genus, *Homo*, evolved nearly modern bodies and bigger brains, becoming the first hunter-gatherers. As these archaic humans spread, they evolved even larger brains and slower-growing bodies. Finally, the fifth transition was the evolution of modern humans, *Homo sapiens*, with our unique capacities for language, culture, and cooperation, which allowed us to become the sole surviving human species on the planet.

However, the story does not end there. Evolution is not just a study of the past; it is an ongoing process. And for humans, the most powerful evolutionary force today is not biological, but cultural. Biological evolution is slow, passing changes through genes from parent to child. Cultural evolution is lightning-fast, passing new ideas and behaviors between any individuals. Two cultural revolutions have been so transformative that they amount to a sixth and seventh transition. The Agricultural Revolution, starting around 10,000 years ago, radically changed our diet and settlement patterns. More recently, the Industrial Revolution began to replace human labor with machines, further altering how we work, live, and interact. These cultural shifts have created the novel environments our bodies are now struggling with.

{% include sidenote.html text="Evolution isn't over. Culture evolves faster than genes. Farming and factories changed our world faster than our bodies could keep up." %}

This sets up the book's central argument: we are caught in a feedback loop, a dynamic the author calls "dysevolution." First, our rapid cultural evolution creates novel environments we are poorly adapted for. Second, this mismatch causes chronic, noninfectious diseases. Third, for various reasons—be it difficulty, cost, or a lack of understanding—we often fail to address the root environmental causes of these diseases. Instead, we use our cultural ingenuity (medicine, technology) to treat the symptoms. This allows the underlying mismatch to persist and even worsen, as we pass on the disease-causing environments and behaviors to the next generation. Understanding this loop—the intricate dance between our ancient, inherited bodies and our rapidly evolving culture—is the key not only to making sense of modern illness, but to finding a way to a healthier future.
