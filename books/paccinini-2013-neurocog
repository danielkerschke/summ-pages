Piccinini, G. (2020). Neurocognitive Mechanisms: Explaining Biological Cognition. Oxford University Press. 

At the most basic level, the mind is always what the brain does. Piccinini argues that to explain thinking, seeing, remembering, or moving, we should describe the concrete machinery in the nervous system that makes these capacities work, because they are often more constituve of mental processes than you'd think. He calls these multilevel “neurocognitive mechanisms.” These mechanisms compute over internal stand-ins for things in the world, which he calls “neural representations.” The big picture rejects two extremes. It is not old-school physical reductionism that tries to erase higher-level talk like “representation.” It is also not anti-reductionism that treats psychology as floating free from biology. Instead, higher-level items are aspects of the lower-level stuff that realizes them. You can talk at either level, because both latch onto the same organized system, just under different descriptions. 

He lays out the roadmap. First he builds a metaphysics of parts and wholes, then defines mechanisms and functions, then cashes out computation and information processing inside mechanisms, then argues that cognition is in fact computational in a brain-specific way. Near the end he treats objections, explains representation and computation in neural terms, and finally asks how consciousness fits. 

# Chapter 1. Levels of Being

Think about a house and its constituent bricks. If the house keeps you warm in winter, who should "really" get the credit? Is it the house as a whole, or each brick on its own? It feels odd to say the house did it and the bricks did it as two separate causes, because that sounds like counting the same thing twice. At the same time, it also feels wrong to say only the bricks matter, because the way the bricks are *arranged* is what makes a house, not a pile.

Piccinini’s point is simple. The house and the bricks are the same organized thing seen at two levels of zoom. The higher level is the house with rooms, walls, and a roof. The lower level is bricks, mortar, and beams. Both levels describe one system, just with different detail. So when you ask what caused the warmth, you can truthfully answer at the house level or at the brick level, and you will be talking about the same underlying event. This is why we do not need to choose a single “real” cause.

He uses the same idea for the brain. A “brain state” and a “neuron state” are not two separate causes fighting for credit. They are two descriptions of one organized mechanism. The brain level is useful when you want a clean, simple picture of what the system is doing. The neuron level is useful when you need the fine details. Using either level does not double count. It just picks the view that makes the explanation easiest to understand.

Why do we even need different levels? Try describing a person only in terms of fundamental particles. You would lose the patterns that matter for explaining walking, speaking, or deciding. So special sciences slice the world into systems and mechanisms where the patterns are visible and useful. Think of zooming a camera until the picture is sharp enough to answer your question. Biology, psychology, and neuroscience each pick a zoom level that lets them see causes that would be invisible at another zoom. These are not arbitrary slices. They carve where nature already has structure, like organs inside a body or circuits inside a brain. 

Now back to the hard puzzle from earlier. If the brain as a whole is in state $S_B$ and the network of neurons is in state $S_NN$, and both seem to bring about the very same action, are we double counting the cause? The simple fix is this: Treat the higher level as an aspect of the lower level, the way the outline of a shape is an aspect of the full drawing that includes shading and texture. The outline “does less” than the full drawing, but it is still real and sometimes, in its internal mechanics, it is the most informative thing to point at. In the same way, a higher-level property causes effects, just not all the effects that the richer, lower-level realizer can bring about. Since the higher-level property is an aspect of the lower one, there is no competition and no redundancy. We did not count twice. We just described the same organized setup at two granularities.

This also tells us when to explain at which level. If your target effect is something a higher-level property is already sufficient to produce, then explaining at that level is not only allowed, it is better. It is clearer, and it avoids dumping tons of micro details that do not help. This is why special sciences exist. They give you the right middle-out description that actually answers the question at hand. The neuron-by-neuron story is often too long and sometimes not even known. The brain-state story can be precise enough to explain and predict. 

What about people who say there is really only one true level, the particle level, and everything else is shorthand. Piccinini answers with a practical test. If you let “arrangement” be a real feature of the world, then you immediately get atoms, molecules, cells, and so on, each with their own genuine properties that matter for explanation. Scientists do not treat “neuron” as a nickname for a huge particle list. They treat it as a stable unit that supports real generalizations and real laws at that level. The success of multilevel science is your clue that multiple levels are not fiction. They are how the world is organized. 

# Chapter 2.

First, what is a mechanism? Think of a mechanism as a set of parts that are put together in a specific way so that they can do something as a whole. A lock has pins and springs. A heart has chambers and valves. What makes these things work is not only the parts. It is also how the parts are arranged in space, how they act over time, and how one part’s activity affects another. That full pattern of parts, layout, timing, and causal influence is the mechanism’s “functional organization.” If you remove the organization, the parts stop producing the effect you care about. 

Now, why talk about mechanisms at all? Because the world comes in organized chunks at many scales. Bodies contain organs. Organs contain tissues. Tissues contain cells. Each scale has its own stable patterns that give the whole system powers it would not have if the parts were just a heap. These powers of the whole come from the parts and their organization, but they are not a second, separate thing. They are aspects of what the organized parts already make possible. This repeats across levels. You can always go down into parts or up into larger systems and keep finding organized mechanisms.

With mechanisms in hand, we can talk about multiple realizability. Here is the basic idea. Sometimes the same higher-level capacity can be built in more than one lower-level way. Think about “being a table.” You can support a round top on three separate legs. You can also cross two legs and put the third in the middle. Different organizations of parts, yet both count as tables if they still support the top in a stable way. That is one source of multiple realizability: same component types, different organization, same higher-level capacity (or function). Sometimes it's useful to model the function without thinking abotu the underlying details, but sometimes it's impossible, it depends.

There is another source of multiple realizability. You can also swap the *component types* while keeping the *organization* the same. Picture a corkscrew that uses metal parts versus one made from a very strong plastic, both arranged with the same screw-and-lever layout. Or think of different styles of mousetrap. The parts are different kinds, yet the organizational pattern that does the job can be held fixed. In practice, both sources can combine. You can change the kinds of parts and also change the way they are arranged, and still keep the same higher-level role. This is why the same function can show up in many physical guises.
