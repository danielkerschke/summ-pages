Silberman begins on a cruise ship full of programmers in the year 2000. He is covering a “Geek Cruise” for Wired magazine, and the star on board is Larry Wall, who created the programming language Perl. Perl has a community motto that says there is more than one way to do a task. Silberman notices that this motto is not just a coding preference. It hints at a bigger point about minds and problem solving, because **different minds can reach good answers in different ways.** That idea is going to matter a lot once the book turns to autism.

  During and after that trip, Silberman keeps bumping into autism in the lives of well known tech figures. Wall mentions that he and his wife have an autistic daughter. While profiling the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Judy Estrin, Silberman learns that her brother in law’s family also has an autistic daughter. A special education teacher overhears him in a café and says there is an epidemic of autism in Silicon Valley. This is a shock to him, because **his picture of autism comes from the movie Rain Man, which makes autism seem both rare and extreme.** The surprise pushes him to start reading research papers and news stories. 
  -- This book basically argues the point "people can be mildly autistic", especially with the popular figure of the Silicon Valley tech lord now (that people are aware of as having more power than finance bros actually), that is nothing new. Popular wisdom, actually, even epidemic of too many people. And I think people are even getting the notion that people are using autism as an excuse to criticize anything that remotely makes them feel bad or uncomfortable-

  To orient the reader, Silberman sketches the **standard origin story** that many people were taught. In 1943, the psychiatrist Leo Kanner in the United States described children who seemed cut off from others and very sensitive to change. He named this pattern “autism,” from the Greek word for self, because the children seemed happiest alone. (This is the secret meaning behind the term [[ Autistic jouissance ]], I think. It has a cognitive meaning of activities that are dependent only on the self and some external, non-human object: see the typical autistic tech nerd preferring to spend as much time as possible in the world of video games or programming systems. Is this fair, since autistic people prefer social video games? Who knows! But the critical theorists at least apply the coprrect definition.) A year later, in Vienna, Hans Asperger described bright, talkative children with social difficulties and unusual interests. He called their condition autism too, and nicknamed them his “little professors.” (This was actually my nickname in Kindergarten.) For decades after that, estimates said only a handful of children in ten thousand were autistic. Then the numbers began to rise in the 1980s and 1990s. Silberman sees that this is not just a Silicon Valley story. He finds the rise nearly everywhere people check.
