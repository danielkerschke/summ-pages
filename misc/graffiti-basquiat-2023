Sycamore, Graffiti Gentrification: Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore on the Exploitation of Basquiat. https://lithub.com/graffiti-gentrification-mattilda-bernstein-sycamore-on-the-exploitation-of-basquiat/

The piece uses a simple setup. Sycamore watches a documentary about Jean-Michel Basquiat, then steps outside into a changing Baltimore neighborhood and lets the two scenes talk to each other. Basquiat is the touchstone because his story has become a familiar myth in popular culture: a brilliant young artist, pushing boundaries, lifted up by the art market, and gone far too early. Sycamore argues that repeating this myth without fresh insight mostly feeds a money machine. It keeps selling a fantasy of the lone genius while ignoring the systems that profit from that fantasy and the harm that follows, especially for Black artists and communities.

From there, the essay turns to the street. The author walks out of the historic Parkway Theatre and notices the sales pitch everywhere. Posters promise “The Art of Baltimore” next to brand-new apartments. There are galleries, a theater-bar complex, and an official “arts district” label. All of this is framed as creative energy. Yet right next to it are very real signs of neglect: people numbed by decades of disinvestment, bulletproof glass at the corner store, and blocks of shuttered businesses. The contrast is the point. If you only look at the branding, you might think art is flowering. If you widen the frame, you see that the “flowering” is being used to sell a version of the city that leaves many of its current residents out.

-- Sycamore then follows the money. Renovations cost many millions. Foundations and real-estate nonprofits fund sleek cultural spaces. University programs move into refitted buildings. Marketing copy promises that living here will let you “paint your own canvas,” while studio rents start at a price that many locals cannot afford. These details are not random. They illustrate a pattern where “arts investment” often works as a wedge. It draws in new tenants and visitors by using the aura of creativity, then helps reset prices and norms. The city gets a new story to tell about itself. The question Sycamore keeps nudging is simple: who is that story for, and who pays the price for telling it this way?

Graffiti becomes a symbol for how culture gets repackaged. In the film, graffiti signals raw inventiveness. On the Baltimore block, there is a sanctioned graffiti alley that functions like a backdrop for photo shoots. The same visual language that once marked an outsider practice now decorates a curated lifestyle. You can sense the irony. A show about “undoing redlining” sits inside a complex that helps make the neighborhood feel marketable, while the historical harms of redlining still shape who has housing security nearby. The old neighborhood becomes a stage set, and “edginess” becomes a selling point. That is how a scene turns into a product.

The closing insight is a quiet warning. People often move to neighborhoods because they feel alive and different. That difference comes from the people already there, with their own histories, struggles, and cultures. When those same qualities get turned into a marketing hook, the cycle speeds up. New money arrives, costs rise, and the original community gets pushed out. In Sycamore’s telling, Basquiat’s legacy is pulled into that cycle as a logo for cool rather than a challenge to power. The result is a city that looks more polished, yet has fewer places for the people who gave it texture in the first place (Sycamore, 2023).
