# Lion's Mane (*Hericium erinaceus*)
---

Hericium is a genus of edible mushrooms in the family Hericiaceae. Species in this genus are white and fleshy and grow on dead or dying wood; fruiting bodies resemble a mass of fragile icicle-like spines that are suspended from either a branched supporting framework or from a tough, unbranched cushion of tissue. People have eaten it for centuries, and scientists study it because it contains small natural molecules that seem to talk to brain cells. Two families of these molecules show up a lot in the research: hericenones from the fruiting body and erinacines from the mycelium, which is the root-like growth that lives in substrate. These compounds are the reason you hear about lion’s mane and nerve growth in the same sentence.

### What it seems to do in the brain.

The simplest way to understand the lab work is this. Some lion’s mane compounds encourage support cells in the brain to make more nerve growth factor, often shortened to NGF. NGF is one of the body’s “grow and maintain” signals for neurons, especially cholinergic neurons that help with attention and memory. Early chemistry papers isolated hericenones and erinacines and showed they stimulate NGF production in cells (Kawagishi et al., 1991; Kawagishi et al., 1994). In living rats, giving erinacine A raised NGF and catecholamine levels in brain regions involved in arousal and memory, which suggests these molecules are bioactive in the brain and not just in a dish (Shimbo et al., 2005). In aging mice, daily lion’s mane improved recognition memory and increased new neuron formation in the hippocampus and even in the cerebellum, which fits the NGF story you just read (Ratto et al., 2019). Outside the brain, an oral hot-water extract sped up recovery after a crushed peripheral nerve in rats, with earlier return of function and better reinnervation, which points to repair support along nerves more broadly (Wong et al., 2011).

### Likely Mechanisms.

Think of lion’s mane as turning up the volume on the brain’s own growth and maintenance signals. One line of work found hericerin derivatives that activate a broad, pan-neurotrophic pathway in hippocampal neurons, converging on ERK signaling, and those mice showed stronger memory readouts along with higher neurotrophin signaling in the brain (Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023). Another common theme in models is calmer immune signaling inside the brain. Reviews summarize reductions in pro-inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress markers after lion’s mane or erinacine-rich extracts, which would make the cellular environment less hostile to neurons trying to repair and connect (Szućko-Kociuba et al., 2023).

### Human Evidence.

Human studies exist, but they are small and mixed, so treat them as early signals rather than proof. In a 16-week double blind trial in 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, 3 grams per day of powdered fruiting body improved scores on a dementia screening test during supplementation, and the benefit faded a month after stopping, which implies any effect may require continued intake (Mori et al., 2009). In a 4-week trial in menopausal women, cookies containing fruiting body were linked with lower depression and anxiety scores than placebo, though the sample was small and the outcome was mood rather than memory (Nagano et al., 2010). In a 49-week pilot study in mild Alzheimer’s disease, an erinacine A enriched mycelial product led to better performance on standard cognitive and functional measures compared with placebo, with a few dropouts for mild gastrointestinal and skin complaints, which speaks to both tentative benefit and tolerability boundaries (Li et al., 2020). In healthy young adults, a 28-day pilot reported faster performance on a Stroop attention task after a single dose and a trend toward lower perceived stress across the month, alongside several null results, which means we need bigger, longer studies to know what carries through (Docherty et al., 2023).

[[ I would be sceptical because the effect, if any, is tiny and contingent on individual factors, making it very difficult to isolate. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/ ]]
