Interview with Henrik Karlsson about writing. (n.d.). YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch/EzWeQeWpHjY

The conversation unfolds around a five step method for writing that Henrik Karlsson arrived at by looking back at which of his essays actually worked. The pattern he found is simple to name and slow to do. First, he spends a long stretch exploring. This does not mean a weekend of research. It means months or even a year of reading books, having many small conversations, keeping notes, and letting the topic live inside him until it stops feeling like a neat idea and starts feeling personal. What signals that he is ready is what he calls the animating question. That is a question that raises the stakes for him as a person, not as a blogger. It might touch who he is as a partner or a parent or a friend. When the question feels urgent in his body, the project has energy.

Why begin with an animating question instead of a topic. Because a topic sits still. A strong question pulls you through the piece. Think of an essay as movement through a landscape. In a novel the movement often comes from a character who wants something and faces obstacles. In an essay the movement comes from a mind that needs an answer and cannot rest until it closes the loop. Without that need, a draft becomes a list of points that never quite adds up to a journey.

Step two begins once the question has heat. Now the raw material he has been collecting gets pulled into shape. He describes the question as a magnetic field. It attracts notes, scenes, quotes, and arguments, and it starts arranging them. In this phase he looks for clusters. You can picture an essay not as a string of paragraphs, but as a few strong centers that belong together. Each center is a small unity. Put the right unities side by side and something extra happens in the space between them.

Step three is ordering the ideas. This is trickier than it sounds because thinking does not happen in a straight line. In his head, images and arguments form a net where everything connects to everything else. Writing has to turn that net into a line, one moment after another. The order matters because you are shaping not only what the reader knows, but the emotional state they are in when they meet the next thing. Tell a small story first and a theory will land differently than if you lead with the theory. He tests sequences by feel. He imagines moving these clusters around and notices when energy releases in his body. That release tells him the order is right.

Step four is writing the core. Once the sequence snaps, he tries to draft quickly, riding the momentum he feels. The goal is to capture the living energy of the idea before it cools. He often dictates on a sofa with his eyes closed, then transcribes, and sometimes repeats that loop several times until it coheres. He avoids building a patchwork from scattered fragments because it tends to lack wholeness. Instead he prefers one fast pass that creates a single arc, even if it will need heavy editing later.

Step five is editing. A practical habit helps him a lot. He writes the introduction and the ending last. When he tries to craft a grand opening first, he gets tense, the prose gets pretentious, and he wastes hours. Once the body exists, the true opening is usually already somewhere in the middle as a throwaway line. He simply moves it up. The ending benefits from the same delay. After you know what the piece really says, you can exit cleanly.

A major thread running through the talk is focus on the thing rather than the page. It is easy to get lost in the sound of our sentences and forget that writing is meant to match reality. He uses case studies from his life and from friends. He will compare his claims to biographies and hard examples. He does still life exercises where he looks at a plant and tries to describe exactly what is there, then corrects himself. That practice teaches humility. You notice how much you were not seeing. A shadow is not simply dark. It might be yellow in one place and purple in another. The same discipline, applied to ideas, keeps them honest.

He also interrogates himself on paper. In the margins he writes questions like, what do you mean by that. Can you name three concrete examples. Can you name a counterexample. This turns the draft into a dialogue. He shows work to his editor, who happens to be his wife, and together they test statements against lived data. Over months the text becomes smarter than he is, because it accumulates feedback and preserves reasoning he would forget.

There is a part of writing that is about feeling, not just logic. When he writes about emotion, he tries to drop into his body and speak the piece aloud while he is in that state. Readers often care less about perfectly packaged advice and more about the energy they can feel in the prose. He gives the example of his essay about meeting his wife. Years later he thinks half the advice in it is shaky. What carried the piece was that you can feel how much he loves her. The feeling is the real payload.

Why write at all. He says it makes him feel more alive. Writing brings the world into him and changes him. The process often follows a pattern that feels like cleaning a messy room. You start simple, then as you examine your assumptions, everything gets worse. Confusions multiply. If you keep going, understanding snaps into a new, cleaner order. So the confusion is not a bug. It is a tunnel you go through to reach a better simplicity.

On openings and promises, he contrasts two modes. One is the big canonical essay that makes a bold promise up front. Those can be worth it, but they are painful to write because you must deliver on the promise. The other is a small doorway essay that begins with a modest observation, asks a curious question, and then explores. The second mode lets him be playful and often ends up overdelivering. Readers feel like they are walking alongside a mind that is discovering, not preaching. Leaving a few dead ends in place preserves that feeling of discovery without drowning the reader in detours.

He talks about rhythm and texture too. He listens for flow with his whole body. Long, smooth passages should be broken by a short snap. Intellectual sections benefit from a sudden concrete image. He likes to mix chords, meaning he juxtaposes elements that do not seem to belong together until they harmonize. This is more craft than rule. You learn it by reading aloud, pausing, and noticing how your body responds.

Ideas are easier to find in a life designed for them. He cultivates interesting friends and long conversations. He reads odd books slightly off the beaten path. He cross pollinates fields, like bringing machine learning intuitions into literary thinking. He takes long walks without the internet. Patience is the soil where unlikely connections form. Over time he has chosen to go deep rather than wide. That meant saying no to music and programming so that he could focus on family and writing. He thinks clearly about what to give up, because depth requires sacrifice.

There is also a social hazard to manage. Young ideas are fragile. Early critique can squish them before they have mass. He protects them by keeping them private at first and by working in ways that make him forget an audience exists. Journals help because honesty comes easier when no one is watching. Later, when the idea has grown, he exposes it to reality checks and to other minds.

Language comes up as well. He writes in English, but his native languages are Danish and Swedish, which give him more freedom to move word order around for rhythm. He wishes English would absorb more weirdness from other languages, but he notes the social cost of looking ungrammatical. On large language models, he uses them lightly. They are helpful for vocabulary, quick grammar checks, and catching his overused tics. They are useful for research. He has not yet seen them produce literature that feels alive. For now, he wants the core of his prose to come from that long, slow, human process.

The conversation closes by returning to the deep structure of writing. Inside your head, experience is a network of smells, images, memories, and arguments that all resonate at once. Writing must turn that network into a line the reader can follow. If you order that line with care, something lovely happens on the other end. The line blooms back into a network in the reader’s mind, filled with their own associations and feelings. That is the whole trick. Begin with a question that matters, gather real material until clusters appear, choose an order that shapes understanding and feeling, write the core while the energy is hot, then edit with patience. Along the way, look at the world more than you look at your words, and protect the newborn ideas until they can stand.

[[More detail on ordering, which is ime a problem when a piece is very complex. You keep forgetting what you're talking about because each aspect is so hard to understand.]]

Ordering, for Henrik, is less about shuffling paragraphs and more about shaping the reader’s mental and emotional path from a first small “oh, interesting” to a final “that lands.” He begins with the animating question as a compass. That question is the reason the piece exists. He then gathers what he called clusters, which are little centers of meaning. A cluster could be a scene, a claim, a pattern you noticed, or a quote that keeps tugging at you. When he thinks about order, he asks a simple thing for each cluster: what needs to be in the reader’s head so that this part lands the way I want. That one sentence turns order from guesswork into cause and effect.

He does not try to hold the whole essay in his head at once, and you do not need to either. He externalizes the structure so his brain can relax. Think of five to seven clusters written as short, plain labels. Under each label, write one sentence that says what the reader should know or feel after that section. For example, “After this, the reader should see why the old approach fails on edge cases.” These are purpose lines. When you line up purpose lines, you can see dependencies. Any purpose that starts with “see why” probably wants an earlier part that shows the problem, not just names it. Any purpose that asks the reader to trust you probably wants a small concrete story before a theory. By moving the labels until each purpose is achievable by what came just before, you get a clean sequence without needing to remember every paragraph.

He also thinks about texture, not just logic. Pure logic can be flat. He imagines the reader’s energy across the piece. Start with a small, vivid moment that is easy to enter. Then a short, clear claim. Then another concrete bit that makes the claim feel real. He alternates concrete and abstract so the reader’s attention does not glaze over. He listens for “release,” which is his word for the feeling that the next part wants to happen. You can find this without mysticism. Read the end of one section and the opening line of the next out loud. If you feel a tiny jolt of impatience, the order is probably wrong. If your body relaxes, you are likely in the pocket. That is the release he mentions.

He does re-read, but in a very specific, low-cost way. He does not re-read the whole draft from top to bottom every time. He runs flyovers. One flyover is just the headings or cluster labels, out loud, in order. Another flyover is only the first and last sentence of each section, which lets him test the handoffs. Another is a skim for the question ladder, which is the sequence of questions the essay raises and answers. If the next paragraph answers a question the reader has not yet felt, he moves things around. These short re-reads are light enough that you can do them many times without drowning in your own text.

There is a tiny trick he uses to help ordering snap sooner. Write a spine sentence. The spine is one long sentence that goes like this: “I start with X because it shows Y, which makes Z plausible, which lets me argue A, which leads to B, so I can finally show C.” You do not need to show this to anyone. It is a private skeleton. When the spine feels right, you hang your clusters like beads along it. If the spine breaks anywhere, you felt the weakest link before you wasted time polishing paragraphs that would have needed to move.

He pays close attention to cause and effect between sections. Each section should either cause the next, or create the need for the next. A clean way to test this is what screenwriters call the “because therefore” rule. Between any two neighboring parts, you can say “because” or “therefore” and it makes sense. If you can only say “and then,” the link is weak, and the reader will feel a seam. You do not need to geek out about this. It is just a sanity check you can run on your headings in five minutes.

Openings and endings wait until the middle is solid. This choice also reduces memory load. Once your core sequence is working, the true opening will usually be hiding inside one of your sections as a throwaway line or a small scene that has the right temperature. Moving that up saves you from struggling to invent a grand opening while you are still unsure about the order. The ending is the mirror image. When you know the real claim your essay earned, you can exit in a clean, calm way that fits the path you built.

Here is a compact workflow you can drop into your current project without needing to juggle the whole thing in your head. Pull out the five to seven strongest clusters you already have. Give each a short label and a one sentence purpose line. Arrange them so that each purpose is achievable by what came before. Read only labels out loud and listen for any bump. Fix bumps. Read only first and last sentences of each section and fix handoffs. Write a spine sentence that moves from first cluster to last through “because” and “therefore.” If you get stuck, insert a small, concrete scene right before an abstract claim. When the sequence gives you that small feeling of release, draft the core quickly. You can polish later.

Two final helpers make this smoother when your head feels crowded. Keep a tiny side list called “promises made.” Whenever you hint you will explain or prove something, add a three word note to that list. As you order sections, check that each promise has a home later. That keeps the reader’s trust clean without making you re-read everything. Also keep a short “do not lose” list for any image, example, or phrase you love. You can place those jewels after the sequence is stable, which stops them from hijacking the order just because they sparkle.

All of this is meant to lower strain. Ordering is not memory gymnastics. It is a path-finding task where you make the steps visible on paper and test only the joints where one step meets the next. When you work like that, the whole piece becomes manageable even when the subject is large, and the final experience for the reader feels like an easy walk that kept deepening in meaning.
