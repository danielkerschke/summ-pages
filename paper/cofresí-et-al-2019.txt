In their comprehensive review, Cofresí and colleagues (2019) propose that the Incentive Salience Sensitization (ISS) theory provides a powerful framework for understanding one of the primary pathways to alcohol use disorder (AUD). The core of this theory is the distinction between the pleasurable effects of a drug ("liking") and the motivational drive to obtain it ("wanting," or incentive salience). The authors argue that addiction is not primarily driven by a desire for pleasure, but rather by a pathological amplification of "wanting." This occurs as repeated alcohol use progressively sensitizes the brain's motivational circuits, making them hypersensitive to alcohol-related cues. As a result, these cues (e.g., the sight of a bottle, the environment of a bar) become powerfully motivating, capable of triggering intense craving and driving compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior, even when the individual no longer finds significant pleasure in drinking and is aware of its negative consequences.

The neurobiological foundation of "wanting" lies within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. This system acts as an "incentive salience attributor," with neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) releasing dopamine into key brain regions like the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. This dopamine signal does not encode pleasure itself, but rather tags environmental cues as motivationally important, transforming them into "motivational magnets." When this system is activated by an alcohol-predictive cue, it triggers a cascade of behavioral and physiological responses, including attentional bias (our attention is captured by the cue), approach tendencies, and autonomic arousal. These subconscious processes constitute the state of "wanting," which can intrude into consciousness as the subjective feeling of craving, especially when the automatic impulse to seek alcohol is blocked or interrupted.

The review provides extensive evidence from preclinical animal models demonstrating how alcohol systematically alters this brain circuitry. Initially, alcohol itself causes dopamine release, but with repeated exposure, a critical shift occurs: the brain's dopamine response to alcohol itself diminishes, while the response to cues that predict alcohol becomes amplified. These neuroadaptations—including changes in dopamine tone, receptor density, and synaptic plasticity—are long-lasting, persisting through withdrawal and protracted abstinence. This process creates a sensitized state where the brain is primed to overreact to alcohol-related cues, providing a biological basis for the persistence of craving and the high risk of relapse seen in AUD.

-- how do they know it's not alcohol taht provides the baseline, if taking it away causes withdrawals = baseline crash. maybe overreaction is just the only thing that brings dopamine, because previously entire baseline. and dopamine is only designed to maintain its recent baseline, right? so, will not care about other rewards immediately.
