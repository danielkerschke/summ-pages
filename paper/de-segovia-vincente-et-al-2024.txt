Combining ESM and log-data to examine the link between mindless scrolling, goal conflict, guilt, and daily well-being, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2024, zmad056, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmad056

A recent study by Vicente, Van Gaeveren, Murphy, and Vanden Abeele (2024) investigated how "mindless scrolling"—defined as passive social media consumption without a goal or purpose—impacts psychological well-being. Utilizing a robust, mixed-methods design that combined over 67,000 ecological momentary assessments (ESM) with behavioral smartphone log-data from 1,315 adults, the researchers found that mindless scrolling is not a harmless behavior. Their analysis revealed a strong association between the time spent mindlessly scrolling and an increase in feelings of guilt about smartphone use (Vicente et al., 2024). This is consistent with the idea that users recognize the behavior as wasteful or unproductive, leading to negative self-evaluations.

The study explored the mechanisms behind this association, identifying goal conflict as a partial mediator between mindless scrolling and guilt. Goal conflict occurs when an individual’s media use takes time away from more beneficial or productive activities (Vicente et al., 2024). When people realize that their scrolling behavior conflicts with other goals they hold, they are more likely to feel guilty. Furthermore, the study found that individuals with lower self-control were particularly prone to experiencing goal conflict after mindlessly scrolling, making them more vulnerable to subsequent feelings of guilt. While the impact of being at work on this dynamic was also examined, the context of lower self-control was a stronger predictor of goal conflict (Vicente et al., 2024).
