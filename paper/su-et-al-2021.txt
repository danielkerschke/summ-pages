"VTA showed significant positive activation in response to the PV, but not to the GV, and the difference between the two conditions was statistically significant." (Section 3.5, Page 5)

"The fMRI results showed higher brain activations in sub-components of the default mode network (DMN)... when viewing personalized videos in contrast to non-personalized ones." (Abstract, Page 1)
"The dMPFC subsystem of DMN... [was] more active under the PV condition than under the GV condition." (Discussion, Pages 5 & 6)
