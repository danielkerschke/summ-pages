This study investigated why TikTok can feel so uniquely absorbing and potentially addictive compared to other social media platforms. The central idea is that TikTok’s design—an endless, full-screen, algorithm-driven feed of short videos—is exceptionally good at inducing a psychological state known as "flow." This is an immersive, almost autopilot-like state where a person becomes so engrossed in an activity that they lose track of time and their surroundings. To test this, the researcher surveyed young adults about their use of TikTok and Instagram, measuring the intensity of their flow state, self-reported addictive behaviors, and other psychological factors like anxiety, boredom, and self-esteem.

The research found that users experience a significantly stronger sense of flow on TikTok than on Instagram. In particular, participants reported much greater "time distortion" (losing track of time) and a lower "feeling of control" (finding it difficult to stop scrolling) while using TikTok. This was supported by the finding that users tended to underestimate how much time they actually spent on the app. Crucially, these aspects of flow were directly correlated with addictive behaviors. Furthermore, the study revealed that TikTok users, unlike Instagram users, reported higher levels of boredom proneness and anxiety compared to non-users.

While traditional flow is often associated with productive activities like sports or art, TikTok facilitates a more passive, non-productive version that is linked to negative outcomes. The app's design effectively hijacks our attention by creating an effortless, rewarding experience, but this may come at the cost of users' time, focus, and emotional well-being, highlighting that the platform's features can have powerful and concerning effects.
