The article asks a simple question with big consequences: what kind of “enjoyment” does Tao Lin’s novel Taipei put on display, and how does that enjoyment shape how we read it? The author’s answer uses a few key ideas from psychoanalysis, then applies them to the book’s worlds of drugs, internet life, race, and disability. Start from first principles. Lacan uses “jouissance” to name a kind of too-intense enjoyment that mixes pleasure with pain. It happens when our drives push past the usual limits set by social rules and language. “Autistic jouissance,” a term used by Lacanians like Jacques-Alain Miller and Slavoj Žižek, highlights **a style of enjoyment that turns inward and away from the social world, often through repetitive self-stimulation, drug use, or tech-mediated routines**. The paper’s core claim is that Taipei builds an aesthetic on this inward, isolating charge, and that this helps explain the book’s style, its content, and even why many readers say it feels boring, affectless, or “too much.” 

To make this intuitive, follow the character Paul. He takes opioids, MDMA, LSD, and more, not to party, but to dampen anxiety and manage contact with others. Drugs here are a shortcut from the slow path of words and customs straight to the body’s switches. Žižek describes drugs as promising a “pure,” almost wordless enjoyment by hitting the brain’s reward circuits without the usual detour through other people. That promise tempts because ordinary life always involves waiting, naming, and negotiating (which Lacan says lead to the potential for jouissance when these are circumvented). In Taipei, the shortcut brings side effects. Paul often loses desire rather than finding it. He keeps chasing intensity, but the more he chases, the flatter and more detached he becomes. The paper reads this as a textbook case of autistic jouissance: high stimulation plus social withdrawal, repetition instead of goals, and a loop that both soothes and empties. 

The article also shows how race and disability get tangled in this loop. Lin has been called “autistic” in hostile ways, and Asian American men are often stereotyped as robotic or affectless. The novel dodges fixed racial labels in its cast, yet race returns in scenes about belonging and visibility. The paper argues that public talk about Lin often treats his cool tone, heavy drug use, and internet self-documentation as a kind of obscene enjoyment that must be judged, which mirrors how societies police the “Other’s” enjoyment. In simple terms, people get mad at what they imagine someone else is enjoying. This is how racism and ableism work together: they project a special, unfair enjoyment onto the other person, then punish them for it. Reading Taipei through autistic jouissance exposes that projection and turns it into an aesthetic question rather than only a moral one. 
-- **What?** In the book, Paul often uses drugs and records people with his phone. He does it quietly and for himself, not to bond with others. Reviewers and onlookers outside the story have called that flat, inward style “autistic” or “robotic,” and they sometimes tie that to Tao Lin being Asian American. That is the specific point the article is after. Race is not shouted through big speeches or labels inside the plot. It shows up in the way people talk about the author and the character’s cool tone, as if an Asian American man who seems affectless must be enjoying the wrong things and in the wrong way. The novel shows scenes of withdrawal, repetition, and device use. Public talk then reads those scenes through a stereotype that says, he must get a weird private kick from this. That is how race returns: through judgments about who belongs, who is visible, and what kind of pleasure is allowed to be seen. Paul turns inward, films, avoids eye contact, and uses substances to manage contact. Second, that mismatch makes observers uneasy. We do not know what he feels, so we guess. Third, the guess hardens into a story about “their” enjoyment. We imagine he gets a special, unfair charge from detachment or from tech or from drugs. Fourth, we moralize. We call it empty, obscene, or pathological and try to police it. The article says, read the book with this loop in mind. **This paper says to treat that charged guessing as part of the artwork’s design, not only as a sin to condemn. In other words, look at how the novel’s flat style, logging habits, and drug routines create and hold that uneasy charge in the reader. When you shift from “Is this behavior bad” to “How does the book produce and arrange this feeling,” you are turning a moral reflex into an aesthetic question you can inspect piece by piece.**


A second thread is the role of objects. The paper uses a clinical idea called the “autistic object.” Think of it as a thing that soaks up excess charge so a person can tolerate their body and the world. In Taipei, drugs do that job, and so do devices. Phones and laptops act like add-on organs. The novel even imagines “computerization” as a horizon where everything merges into one giant machine. That fantasy is comforting and frightening at once. Comforting, because it promises an end to social friction. Frightening, because it flattens desire and turns life into a static script that keeps running even after you, the person, are gone. The article’s point is that these “I-objects” condense jouissance but also reshape the drives, which helps explain Paul’s numbness and the book’s meticulous logging of clicks, messages, and footage. 
-- Think of an “I-object” as a thing that acts like an extra piece of you, such as a phone, a camera, or a pill. It gives you a tiny loop you can fully control. Tap. Dose. Record. Repeat. That loop soaks up the extra charge that would otherwise spill into messy, unpredictable contact with people. That is what “condensing jouissance” means here. The object gathers the thrill and the sting into a small, repeatable routine. Over time your body learns to chase the routine itself. The drive stops aiming at a person or a goal and starts aiming at the next click, the next dose, the next clip. Repetition makes the feelings flatter and safer, which shows up as numbness. And because the object likes clean inputs, you start to make the world into data so the loop can run again. You log the clicks, save the messages, and film the moments, so the next pass can match the last one.

Finally, the paper reframes why many readers find Taipei “ugly” or “boring.” In classical aesthetics, the beautiful and the good invite calm agreement. By contrast, the ugly can force on us an enjoyment we do not want, for example by dwelling on illness, damage, or repetition. Taipei leans into that discomfort on purpose. It fills pages with drug sensations, loops, and awkward bodily detail. That insistence can feel disgusting or deadening, which is the point. The author argues that this “ugly object” aesthetic can actually bring desire back. When we let ourselves face the unpleasant charge directly, rather than covering it with moral lessons or tidy identities, a different desire can reappear on the far side of the discomfort. Even Paul’s near-death hallucination of “becoming computer” sets up a return: he hears himself say he is grateful to be alive. The paper reads that as a flicker of desire after passing through symbolic death. 

Put it all together. The essay claims that Taipei is not simply a drug book, a tech diary, or an identity novel. It is an experiment that turns inward enjoyment, social projections about race and disability, and our attachments to devices into an aesthetic engine. That engine runs on autistic jouissance. It shows how modern life builds shortcuts to intensity that can erase desire, and it asks whether facing that erasure head-on might let desire speak again, quietly, from the other side.
