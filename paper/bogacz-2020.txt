The central idea is that dopamineâ€™s main function is to signal a "prediction error," which is simply the difference between what the brain expects and what actually happens. The framework proposes that the brain works to minimize this error in two ways. You can either change your expectations to match reality, which is learning, or you can change reality to match your expectations, which is acting. This dual approach allows dopamine to be the driving force behind both learning about the world and actively engaging with it.

The framework proposes that this process operates through two main systems in the brain. The goal-directed system uses dopamine to signal a reward prediction error. Imagine you want that spoonful of ice cream. This system compares the reward you desire with the reward you'd get from your current motor plan. If you haven't planned a movement yet, there's a large error, and dopamine is released to energize the planning process until a suitable action is formed. Once the plan is complete, the expected reward matches the desired reward, and the error signal quiets down.

In parallel, a separate habit system learns to automate successful actions. Its dopamine signal isn't about reward, but about an action prediction error. It essentially asks, "Is the action I'm taking the one I normally take in this situation?" When the goal-directed system first figures out a new action, the habit system is "surprised" by this unfamiliar move. This dopamine-driven error signal teaches the habit system to mimic and eventually automate that action. Over time, the action becomes a habit that can be executed quickly without deliberate planning.
