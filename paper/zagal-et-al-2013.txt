Zagal, J. P., Bj√∂rk, S., & Lewis, C. (2013). Dark patterns in the design of games. In Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (pp. 240-247).

This paper introduces the concept of "Dark Game Design Patterns," defining them as elements intentionally used by a game's creators to cause negative experiences for players that are against their best interests and occur without their informed consent. The authors distinguish these from simple "bad design," which may be unintentional or the result of incompetence. A dark pattern is a deliberate choice to manipulate the player for the benefit of the developer, such as increasing playtime or generating revenue. The core of a dark pattern is this conflict of interest, where the designer, typically seen as a player's advocate, instead creates systems that exploit the player's psychological biases, time, or social connections.

The authors categorize and provide concrete examples of these dark patterns, breaking them into three main groups based on what is being exploited: time, money, and social capital. Temporal dark patterns include excessive "Grinding," which forces repetitive, low-skill tasks to extend playtime, and "Playing by Appointment," where games like FarmVille punish players for not logging in at specific times by having resources wither. Monetary dark patterns involve deceptive payment models, such as "Pay to Skip," which frustrates players into paying to bypass difficult content, or "Pre-Delivered Content," where players are charged extra to unlock content already on the game disc they purchased. Finally, social dark patterns leverage a player's social network, as seen in "Social Pyramid Schemes," which require players to recruit their friends to make meaningful progress in the game.

-- The authors argue that grinding becomes an induced dark pattern when a game's design deliberately manipulates players into performing tedious, repetitive tasks, not for enjoyment or skill development, but to remain competitive or make progress. This coercion is most evident in multiplayer games where the system is intentionally unbalanced to favor those who invest the most time. The paper explains that designers exploit a "player's competitive nature" by tying crucial advantages to time spent rather than ability, noting how in some games, "What was once purely based on skill is now tipped towards players who have spent more time playing." This design choice effectively "forces some players to grind in order to be competitive," which in turn "spoils the enjoyment of those who refuse to engage in the level grind," creating a coercive loop where playing skillfully is not enough to succeed.


Ultimately, the paper argues that identifying these patterns is not always straightforward, as the "darkness" of a design often depends on its implementation, context, and the player's awareness. The authors' goal is not to condemn specific games or designers but to provide a critical vocabulary for players, critics, and developers to discuss the ethics of game design at a systemic level. By naming and deconstructing these manipulative techniques, they hope to foster a "manipulation literacy" within the gaming community, empowering players to recognize when they are being exploited and encouraging designers to consider the ethical implications of their work.
