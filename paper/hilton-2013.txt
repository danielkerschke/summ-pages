Hilton DL Jr. Pornography addiction - a supranormal stimulus considered in the context of neuroplasticity. Socioaffect Neurosci Psychol. 2013 Jul 19;3:20767. doi: 10.3402/snp.v3i0.20767. PMID: 24693354; PMCID: PMC3960020.

This article argues that compulsive pornography use should be understood as a genuine addiction, not just a bad habit or a moral failing. The author, Dr. Hilton, contends that the reluctance to label it an addiction stems from an outdated view that only focuses on behavior. He proposes that modern neuroscience shows us what is happening "under the hood." The core of his argument is that addiction is a biological process of the brain physically rewiring itself, and this process is the same whether the trigger is a drug like cocaine or a powerful behavioral experience like pornography.

The mechanism behind this addiction is a combination of two key concepts: neuroplasticity and the "supranormal stimulus." Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change its own structure and wiring based on repeated experiences. When you engage in a highly rewarding activity, the brain strengthens the neural pathways for it, making you crave it more. Dr. Hilton explains that internet pornography acts as a "supranormal stimulus"â€”an unnaturally powerful, endlessly novel, and exaggerated version of a natural reward. This potent stimulus essentially hijacks the brain's reward system, causing it to rewire itself much faster and more intensely than it would for a normal, real-life experience, leading to a compulsive, addictive cycle.

-- How does he define superstimuli? He defines the "supranormal stimulus" as an artificially enhanced, exaggerated, and endlessly novel version of a natural reward that becomes more compelling to the brain than its real-world counterpart, thereby hijacking evolutionary drives. He grounds the concept in the work of ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen, who discovered that animals like birds and butterflies "could be duped into preferring artificial substitutes designed specifically to appear more attractive than the animal's normal eggs and mates." Hilton argues that internet pornography is a perfect human example of this phenomenon, stating it is "illustrative of Tinbergen's concept of the 'supranormal stimulus', with plastic surgery-enhanced breasts presented in limitless novelty in humans serving the same purpose as Tinbergen's and Magnus's artificially enhanced female butterfly models." For Hilton, the key components are the combination of artificial exaggeration with an unprecedented level of novelty, which creates a "pheromone-like effect" that is "inhibiting orientation" and disrupts natural mating cues. He crystallizes this idea by citing Naomi Wolf's observation that "the images' power and allure have supplanted that of real naked women," which perfectly encapsulates how this unnaturally potent stimulus can override the brain's attraction to natural, authentic human connection, thus driving the addictive process.
