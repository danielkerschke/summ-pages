Start from the simplest picture. Your brain is a prediction machine. When things happen together, it builds an “association” that helps you predict what comes next, like “tone means shock.” But the world changes, and a single association is not enough. So the brain also tries to guess which hidden situation, or “latent cause,” is active right now. If the current sights, sounds, and timing feel like the old training situation, the brain bets it is the same cause; if not, it treats it as a new cause. This simple idea explains why you can learn fear in one setting and then learn safety later without erasing the original fear. You did not overwrite one link. You stored two links that belong to two different inferred causes. 

Now connect this to “memory modification.” Retrieving a memory is not just reading it. Retrieval is the brain deciding that the old cause is active again, which makes the old association eligible to change. If the experience after retrieval is a little surprising but not wildly off, the brain will keep blaming the old cause and gently adjust the old association. If the surprise is huge, the brain decides “this must be a new cause” and creates a new memory instead. In the model, two processes take turns: one updates associations when a cause is active, and the other updates beliefs about which cause is active. That alternating loop can run for a short while after a cue is presented, which is why a brief retrieval followed by extinction can strongly weaken the original fear memory, but the same extinction without that retrieval mostly builds a separate “safe” memory that competes later. 

From this lens, many classic findings fall out naturally. Extinction usually does not erase learning, so fear can “spontaneously recover” later, because with time the brain becomes less sure that the extinction cause still applies and it gives the old acquisition cause another chance. Stronger or older memories are harder to change, because the surprise on a no-shock trial is big enough to make the brain infer a new cause rather than edit the old one. Short, well-timed retrieval before extinction hits a “sweet spot,” making the brain keep the old cause on line long enough to update it, which matches the Monfils–Schiller effect in rodents and humans. In short, memory change looks like ordinary associative learning gated by a simple inference about hidden causes, not like a special switch that sometimes turns memories “on” or “off.”
