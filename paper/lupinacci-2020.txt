This article argues that social media platforms are designed to keep us in a state of "compulsory continuous connectedness" by creating a permanent sense of anticipation and unsettledness. The key strategy for achieving this is the promotion of "liveness"—the promise that you can have an immediate, real-time connection to happenings, people, and information. Platforms leverage this by making users feel that something remarkable or unexpected could happen at any moment, even during non-eventful, everyday situations. This constant potential for an event encourages users to check, scroll, and engage continuously, which generates the quantifiable data that fuels the platforms' business models.

Drawing on diary entries and interviews with social media users in London, the author explores the deeply ambivalent feelings this environment produces. The findings are categorized into five key themes that capture this contradictory experience. Users feel excitement from the thrill of being first to know and accessing fresh content. However, this is paired with anxiety, driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) and the stress of constant notifications. Users also find reassurance in discovering shared experiences with others in real-time. Yet, this can lead to fatigue, described by participants as "absentmindedly scrolling through nothing" and feeling drained by the endless, often pointless, flow of information. Finally, a sense of responsibility emerges, creating a burdensome duty to be constantly available and responsive to others.
