This article reviews a growing body of research demonstrating that excessive screen time is linked to a wide range of negative physical health outcomes in children and adolescents. The author highlights that key factors include the duration of use, the type of content, and using devices after dark. Physically, excessive screen time is associated with poor sleep, as the blue light from screens can suppress the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin. This leads to a higher risk for cardiovascular problems, including obesity, high blood pressure, and low levels of "good" cholesterol. Other documented physical consequences include impaired vision from eye strain and reduced bone density due to a sedentary lifestyle.

Beyond physical health, the paper details the significant psychological and neurological impact of heavy digital media use. Psychologically, screen-induced sleep deprivation is linked to internalizing behaviors like depression and anxiety, as well as externalizing issues. The author emphasizes a strong connection between screen time—particularly violent and fast-paced video games—and behaviors that mimic Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Neurologically, this occurs because constant, rewarding stimuli activate dopamine pathways in the brain, creating a craving cycle similar to that of substance dependence and altering brain structures involved in emotional regulation and cognitive control.

To illustrate these points, the author presents a compelling case study of a nine-year-old boy diagnosed with ADHD. The boy, who spent up to seven hours a day on screens, showed significant improvement within weeks of a screen time reduction plan. His restlessness decreased, his school performance improved, and his aggressive behavior vanished, suggesting his ADHD-like symptoms were primarily exacerbated or even caused by excessive screen time. The paper concludes that heavy screen use undermines a child's "psychophysiological resilience"—their ability to cope with stress—by harming physical health, weakening social skills, and preventing the development of a calm, focused mind.
