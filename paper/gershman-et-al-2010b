The paper tackles a simple but slippery question in conditioning. When does an animal treat new experience as “the same situation” versus “a different situation,” and how does that choice explain why responses can vanish during extinction yet return in the original or a new context. The authors argue that animals do not just learn cue to outcome links. They also try to guess the hidden situation that generated each trial. Prior models tied the creation of new “states” to negative prediction errors, which struggles with effects like context specific latent inhibition. The authors reframe the problem as statistical inference about latent causes and show that many classic context effects, like ABA and ABC renewal and the context dependence of latent inhibition, follow from this inference problem. 

Here is the core idea in plain terms. Imagine the animal keeps a running set of “buckets,” each bucket representing a latent cause such as “training” or “extinction.” On every trial it asks: does this trial look like what I have already put in one of my buckets, or should I open a new bucket. That decision is guided by a simple prior that prefers few buckets but allows new ones when observations change, and by how well the current context, cue, and outcome match what is in each bucket. Formally this is an infinite capacity mixture model with a Chinese restaurant process prior and online Bayesian updating via particle filtering. Because context helps assign trials to buckets, conditioning and extinction often land in different buckets, which naturally gives ABA renewal, ABC renewal, and the weakening of latent inhibition when preexposure and conditioning happen in different contexts. No special “erase” mechanism is needed.

The authors then connect this inference process to the hippocampus. Their claim is not that the hippocampus stores every association, but that it supplies the capacity to create new buckets when warranted. If you restrict that capacity, by lesions or in immature animals, the system is forced to reuse old buckets. The result is exactly what the literature shows. Renewal is lost because extinction and conditioning share one bucket, and latent inhibition becomes insensitive to context because preexposure and conditioning are averaged together. Simulations that turn off the “new bucket” parameter reproduce these lesion and developmental patterns, offering a unifying account of behavior across tasks, ages, and neural manipulations.
