This study reveals that short video addiction (SVA) is linked to tangible changes in the brain's physical structure, particularly in areas governing reward and decision-making. Researchers found that individuals with higher SVA symptoms had greater gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and cerebellum. The OFC is a critical hub in the brain's reward circuitry, which is heavily modulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine. This finding suggests that the constant stream of novel, engaging, and personalized content acts as a series of "dopamine hits." Over time, this repeated stimulation may physically strengthen the neural pathways that anticipate and process rewards, making the brain more sensitive to the cues of short video apps and driving the compulsive need to continue scrolling.

Beyond structural changes, the research also identified altered patterns of brain activity. Individuals with more severe SVA showed heightened spontaneous activity in regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is responsible for cognitive control and acts as the brain's "brakes." This hyperactivity suggests that the brain's control system is in a state of overdrive, constantly struggling—and often failing—to inhibit the impulse to seek the next dopamine-releasing video. This creates a cycle where the reward system is over-activated by the videos, while the control system becomes exhausted trying to regulate it, ultimately making it harder for the individual to disengage.
