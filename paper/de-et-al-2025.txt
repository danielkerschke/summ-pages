Social media platforms significantly impact the developing brains of adolescents, creating a dependency that mirrors substance addiction.[1] These platforms utilize artificial intelligence to deliver a constant stream of personalized content, which activates the brain's reward system through dopamine release.[2] This process can lead to heightened emotional sensitivity and impaired decision-making in teenagers.[1] Studies have shown that frequent social media use is linked to changes in brain regions responsible for social rewards and punishments, potentially making teens hypersensitive to peer feedback.[3][4] The endless scrolling and notifications create a state of partial attention, distracting from important tasks.[1]

The business model of social media companies, which prioritizes profit and user engagement, raises significant ethical issues, particularly concerning teenagers.[1] These platforms are designed to maximize screen time by creating continuous feeds that keep users engaged for as long as possible.[1][5] This approach has led to concerns about the lack of transparency in how user data is collected and utilized for targeted advertising.[6] For adolescents, who are in a critical phase of development and are more susceptible to rewards, this constant engagement can foster addictive behaviors and negatively impact their mental health.[1][7] There is a growing call for social media companies to be more accountable for the addictive nature of their platforms and the potential harm they may cause to young users.[5][8]
