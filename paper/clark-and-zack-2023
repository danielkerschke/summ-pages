Clark, L., & Zack, M. (2023). Engineered highs: Reward variability and frequency as potential prerequisites of behavioural addiction. Addictive Behaviors, 140, 107626. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2023.107626

The paper’s core claim is painfully simple, which of course makes it awkward that the world keeps ignoring it. The brain learns from surprises. When a reward shows up unpredictably, dopamine pulses register a “better than expected” moment, and those pulses teach you to chase the cues that predict the next hit. Under steady, predictable rewards, that dopamine spike moves to the cue and stops firing at payout. Under uncertain rewards, the spike hits at the cue and again at the payout, which means the system keeps learning, keeps cranking up “wanting,” and never settles. You do not need a drug to get this train moving, you just need variable outcomes delivered often enough to keep prediction errors alive. That is the bridge the authors build from substance addiction to behavioural addictions like gambling, gaming, and compulsive scrolling, by focusing on reward variability, the subjective feeling of uncertainty, and the sheer frequency of trials that modern digital products deliver.
