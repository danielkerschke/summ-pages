In this study, the researchers develop an economic model to formally define and measure "digital addiction" to social media and smartphones. They argue that this addiction can be understood through two key behavioral concepts: habit formation (using a product today increases your desire to use it tomorrow) and self-control problems (people use a product more in the present moment than they would have ideally planned for themselves). To test this model, the authors conducted a large-scale randomized experiment with over 2,000 Android smartphone users, tracking their usage of popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, web browsers, and YouTube.

The experiment involved two main interventions. In one group, participants were temporarily paid to reduce their screen time. The researchers found that even after the payments stopped, these participants continued to use social media less than the control group, providing strong evidence for habit formation. In another intervention, participants were given a tool to set strict, binding daily time limits on their own app usage. The fact that a large majority of participants chose to use these limits and successfully reduced their screen time demonstrates a demand for commitment, which is a classic sign of self-control problems. Additional survey evidence showed that people tend to underestimate their future usage (a form of naivete) and are not fully attentive to how their current use builds future habits.

By interpreting these experimental results through their economic model, the authors draw a powerful conclusion: self-control problems are responsible for a substantial amount of social media activity. Their primary estimate suggests that 31% of all social media use is driven by these self-control issues, amplified by the force of habit formation. This finding provides empirical weight to the argument that a significant portion of digital consumption is not the result of rational enjoyment but stems from addiction-like behaviors, which has significant implications for individual well-being, technology design, and policy debates.
