In Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Article 18, pp. 1-13). Association for Computing Machinery. https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3501899

This paper explores the common experience of "mindlessly scrolling" on social media. The researchers argue that instead of viewing this as an "addiction," it's more accurately described as "normative dissociation." This is a normal psychological state where you become so absorbed in something—like reading a book, daydreaming, or driving a familiar route—that you lose track of time, your surroundings, and your sense of self-awareness. The paper suggests that social media platforms are designed to tap into this natural tendency, pulling users into a dissociative state to maximize their time on the site.

To test this idea, the researchers built a custom Twitter app called "Chirp" and had 43 people use it. Through in-app surveys and interviews, they found that users frequently entered this dissociative state. Sometimes, this experience was positive, feeling like a relaxing and beneficial mental break. More often, however, people would "snap out of it" with a sense of regret, realizing they had wasted time scrolling through content they couldn't even remember, a feeling captured by the paper's title, "I Don't Even Remember What I Read."

The study's key finding is that specific design features can either encourage or prevent this mindless scrolling. The researchers discovered that features designed to increase user awareness significantly reduced dissociation. For example, creating finite content feeds with custom lists, adding a simple label that said "You're all caught up," or showing pop-up reminders about time spent on the app all served as effective "circuit breakers." These interventions gently pulled users out of their absorbed state, gave them back a sense of control, and helped them use social media more intentionally.
