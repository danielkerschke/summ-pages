Van Lier, J., Revlin, R., & De Neys, W. (2013). Detecting cheaters without thinking: Testing the automaticity of the cheater detection module. PLoS ONE, 8(1), e53827. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053827

This study investigates the "cheater detection module," a concept from evolutionary psychology suggesting that humans have a specialized, innate mental mechanism for identifying individuals who violate social contracts (i.e., take a benefit without paying the required cost). This module is hypothesized to be automatic, meaning it operates quickly and effortlessly, independent of a person's general cognitive capacity or intelligence. The researchers tested this core assumption by comparing how people solve a logic puzzle (the Wason selection task) when it is framed as a standard descriptive rule versus when it is framed as a social contract about detecting cheaters.
