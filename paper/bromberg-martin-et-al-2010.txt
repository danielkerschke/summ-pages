Dopamine in motivational control: rewarding, aversive, and
 alerting -  Ethan S. Bromberg-Martin1, Masayuki Matsumoto1,2, and Okihide Hikosaka1


The classic view is that dopamine neurons fire when something better than expected happens, like receiving an unexpected treat. This release of dopamine reinforces the behavior that led to the reward, teaching the brain to seek out that experience again. However, this simple model can't explain why dopamine neurons also fire in response to negative or startling events, like a sudden air puff to the face.

They argue there are different types of dopamine neurons that send distinct messages to different parts of the brain. One type of neuron signals motivational value, acting like a "good vs. bad" meter. It gets excited by rewarding things and is suppressed by aversive ones, helping us learn what to approach and what to avoid. A second type of neuron signals motivational salience, acting as an "importance detector." These neurons are activated by any significant event, whether it's positive or negative, essentially telling the brain, "Pay attention, this is important!"

-- Indeed, I argue that positively and negatively salient just manifest as big bursts of dopamine. Whenever something feels salient and urgent, like running away from a bear, that will be accompanied by strong dopamine. The valence -- whether it feels triumphant or terrifying -- is assigned by something else. (I think it's the endogenous opioids. And of course, norepinephrine/epinephrine are the real "act now" chemicals, but my point is just that dopamine isn't inherently valenced. Something good or bad can be salient.) These three signals—value (good/bad), salience (important/unimportant), and alerting (new/unexpected)—are thought to work in concert, and I would fully agree with that. It's known that there is a surprise function in the brain, that works way faster than conscious awareness even. Should reference that this has been identified as gaps in the literature.

-- Actually, they proved that dopamine neurons fire robustly in response to cues that resolve uncertainty (predicting a future reward), even when no reward is delivered at that moment. They did a specific experiment where the only thing of value being offered was information itself, and that still gave dopamine. Dopamine can have this function. Specifically, when a cue appeared that promised to resolve uncertainty, the dopamine neurons fired strongly. This happened immediately after the cue was shown, long before any juice was delivered. This firing pattern shows that the dopamine system treats the opportunity to gain predictive information as a rewarding event in its own right. They did this in a past study, and they are now interpreting themselves: "*A recent study in monkeys found that DA neurons signal this preference (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009). Monkeys expressed a strong preference to view informative visual cues that would allow them to predict the size of a future reward, rather than uninformative cues that provided no new information.*"
