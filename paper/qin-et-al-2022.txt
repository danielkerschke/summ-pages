Qin, Y., Omar, B., & Musetti, A. (2022). The addiction behavior of short-form video app TikTok: The information quality and system quality perspective. Frontiers in Psychology, 13, 932805. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2022.932805

This study investigates the mechanisms behind TikTok addiction among adolescents by applying the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework. The researchers aimed to understand how external "stimuli" from the app itself—specifically its information quality (e.g., usefulness and relevance of content) and system quality (e.g., responsiveness, ease of use)—influence the user's internal mental state, or "organism." This internal state is defined as the "flow experience," characterized by enjoyment, concentration, and time distortion. The study then examines how this flow experience leads to the final "response" of addictive behavior.

Based on survey data from 659 Chinese adolescents aged 10 to 19, the study found that both the app's information quality and system quality contribute to the user's flow experience. However, the system quality—the seamless and smooth functioning of the app—was a significantly stronger predictor of flow than the quality of the information itself. The flow experience was confirmed to be a critical mediator, directly linking the app's technical environment to addiction. This shows that the immersive feeling users get from TikTok is a key pathway to developing addictive habits.

Think of "system quality" not as what you are watching, but how you are watching it. It’s the behind-the-scenes engineering that makes the user experience completely seamless and effortless. Imagine you're at a buffet. The information quality is the food itself—how tasty and personalized it is. The system quality is how the buffet is run. Is there a long line? Do you need to ask a slow server for a plate? Do the tongs for the food stick? A buffet with poor system quality is frustrating, even if the food is good. TikTok’s system quality is like a magical buffet where the exact food you want appears instantly in front of you on a clean plate the moment you finish your last bite, with zero waiting and zero effort. For example, videos don't buffer. The next one is pre-loaded and ready the microsecond you swipe. There's no "pause" for your brain to reconsider what you're doing. The swipe is a simple, primal, low-effort gesture. You don't have to think, click a small button, or navigate a menu. It’s a mindless, repeatable action. The app rarely crashes or glitches. This perfect performance means the immersive "flow state" is never broken by technical frustration.

-- The personalized content (the information quality) provides the dopamine reward. But the flawless system quality is the relentless delivery mechanism.

-- By combining the scores from these very specific, performance-focused questions, the researchers created a single, powerful "System Quality" score for each user. This score represented how perfectly and frictionlessly that person perceived the app to be operating. They discovered that the high score on "System Quality"—the feeling that the app just works, instantly and flawlessly—was an even stronger driver of addictive flow than the quality of the videos themselves.

The most significant finding is that among the components of flow, deep concentration on the app and its content was the most powerful driver of TikTok addiction. While enjoyment and time distortion also played a role, the mental absorption and intense focus were the primary factors. The study concludes that TikTok addiction is largely determined by the app's ability to capture and hold a user's mental concentration. The authors suggest that practical solutions to curb addiction should focus on interrupting this state of intense focus, either through app design or parental intervention.
