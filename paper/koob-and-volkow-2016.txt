This review explains addiction as a three-stage cycle that progressively dysregulates the brain's motivational systems. The first stage, binge/intoxication, involves the basal ganglia, the brain's reward and habit center. Drugs of abuse cause large releases of neurochemicals like dopamine and opioid peptides, producing euphoria and training the brain to associate drug-related cues with reward. This creates powerful "incentive salience," where cues trigger intense wanting and drive the formation of compulsive drug-seeking habits.

Over time, this cycle leads to the second stage: withdrawal/negative affect. The brain adapts to the drug's presence by weakening its own reward system, leading to a blunted response to both the drug and natural pleasures. Simultaneously, the brain's stress systems, particularly in a region called the extended amygdala, become hyperactive. This "stress surfeit" releases chemicals like corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin, creating a powerful negative emotional state characterized by dysphoria, anxiety, and irritability. At this point, the motivation for drug use shifts from seeking pleasure (positive reinforcement) to escaping this distress (negative reinforcement).

The third stage, preoccupation/anticipation, involves the prefrontal cortex, the brain's executive control center. In this stage, the prefrontal cortex's ability to regulate impulses, make sound decisions, and inhibit inappropriate actions is compromised. The "Go" system driving craving becomes overactive in response to cues, while the "Stop" system responsible for control is weakened. This dysfunction, combined with a blunted reward system and a hyperactive stress system, creates a state of intense craving and a compulsive drive to seek drugs, making it extremely difficult for an individual to maintain abstinence despite severe negative consequences.
