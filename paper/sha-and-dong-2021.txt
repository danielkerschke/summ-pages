Sha, P., & Dong, X. (2021). Research on adolescents regarding the indirect effect of depression, anxiety, and stress between TikTok use disorder and memory loss. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18(16), 8820. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168820

This study investigated the relationship between problematic TikTok use and memory loss among more than 3,000 Chinese high school students. The researchers wanted to understand if the link was direct, or if it was indirectly caused by mental health factors. They hypothesized that excessive TikTok use could lead to increased depression, anxiety, and stress, which would then contribute to memory problems. To measure memory, they used forward and backward digit span tests, which assess how many numbers a person can recall in sequence.

The results confirmed that problematic TikTok use was linked to poorer memory. The researchers found this connection works in two ways. First, there was a direct link where higher TikTok use disorder was associated with lower memory scores. Second, there was a significant indirect link, where problematic TikTok use was associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and these mental health symptoms were, in turn, linked to worse memory performance. This means that mental health acts as a partial bridge, or mediator, explaining how excessive social media use can impact cognitive functions like memory.

A surprising finding emerged when the data was separated by gender. Although female students reported higher levels of problematic TikTok use, male students exhibited significantly more depression, anxiety, stress, and greater memory loss. The study concludes that while problematic social media use is a concern for all adolescents, male students may be more vulnerable to its negative mental health and cognitive consequences. The authors suggest that special attention should be paid to this group to address these issues.
