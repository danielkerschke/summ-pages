Your brain has two ways to choose actions: a planner that thinks ahead using a mental map of how the world works (model based), and a habit system that just repeats what paid off before (model free). The paper argues there is a referee that watches which one is doing a better job right now. It checks each system’s recent mistakes: state prediction errors for the planner, reward prediction errors for the habit system. When the planner’s errors are small, control shifts toward planning; when habits are reliably right, control shifts toward habits. Brain scans point to parts of lateral prefrontal and frontopolar cortex carrying these “who’s more reliable” signals, with a comparison signal in cingulate cortex. Think of it like two drivers sharing a car, and a strict friend in the front seat deciding who gets the wheel based on who has been steering straighter lately.

To test this, people played a simple two step token game. Sometimes only one token color paid (so you had to plan), sometimes any color paid (so habits could work), and the paths between steps were sometimes predictable and sometimes random. The authors built a model that estimates reliability for each system, then mixes their value estimates with a single weight that slides between them. In the brain, classic reward error signals showed up in striatum, state errors in a fronto parietal network, the reliability signals in inferior lateral prefrontal and frontopolar cortex, and an integrated final value in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In plain terms, the scan pattern matches the idea that a prefrontal “arbiter” tallies which strategy is currently trustworthy and dials the blend accordingly.

The twist that makes this useful is how control changes. The arbiter seems to work mostly by turning down the volume of the habit circuits when planning should lead, rather than pushing directly on the planning circuits. Picture a club bouncer who hushes the loud regular so the careful friend can be heard. That fits the behavior data, explains why planning takes a bit longer and more effort, and hints at why habits can overrun choices in conditions like addiction or OCD, plus where you might target interventions in the prefrontal system. Bottom line: your choices are a live blend of planner and habit, and a prefrontal judge keeps score in real time, handing the mic to whoever is proving more reliable in that moment.
