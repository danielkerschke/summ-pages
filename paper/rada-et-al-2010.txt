Rada, P., Barson, J. R., Leibowitz, S. F., & Hoebel, B. G. (2010). Opioids in the hypothalamus control dopamine and acetylcholine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Brain Research, 1312, 1–9. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2009.11.055

This study investigated how opioid activity in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, a brain region that drives eating, affects the neurochemistry of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key area for reward and motivation. Researchers hypothesized that stimulating opioid receptors in the PVN would alter the balance of two critical neurotransmitters in the NAc—dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh)—in a way that promotes consummatory behaviors like eating and drinking. To test this, they injected various opioid-related drugs directly into the PVN of rats while simultaneously measuring the levels of DA and ACh in the NAc.

The results demonstrated a powerful connection between the two brain regions. Injecting opioid agonists like morphine and DAMGO (a potent µ-receptor agonist) into the PVN caused a significant increase in dopamine and a sharp decrease in acetylcholine in the NAc. Conversely, injecting an opioid antagonist (m-naloxone) produced the opposite effect: it decreased dopamine and increased acetylcholine. The study found that the µ-opioid receptor was primarily responsible for these changes, as the µ-agonist DAMGO produced a much stronger effect than the δ-agonist DALA, which only modestly increased dopamine without affecting acetylcholine.

-- Note that, according to [[berke-2018]], it is a decrease in acetylcholine that is critical for learning. When a surprising event occurs that triggers learning (like an unexpected reward cue), two things happen simultaneously: dopamine neurons fire in a burst (the learning signal), and the cholinergic interneurons (CINs) show a brief pause in their firing. So this definitely confirms my idea that opioids mark "to-be-learned" deviations from baseline, with dopaminergic "learning" spikes, which are then continuously sought out by the blind dopamine system.
