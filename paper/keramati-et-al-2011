There are two decision makers in your head. One is quick and routine based. The other is slow and plan based. This paper builds a model that lets a tiny “referee” decide who gets control on each choice. The rule is simple: ask whether taking extra time to plan is worth it. The benefit of planning is the chance to pick a better action. The cost of planning is the reward you lose while you sit there thinking. The model measures benefit with a “value of perfect information” signal and measures cost with a running average of reward per unit time. If benefit beats cost, you engage the planner. If not, the habit system acts. 

They show this rule explains classic behaviors. Early in learning, choices are sensitive to devaluation because the planner is in charge. After lots of training, behavior looks habitual and becomes devaluation insensitive, so reaction time drops. When two equally good options are offered at the same time, the model keeps you goal directed even after heavy training, which matches data. It also captures patterns in reversal tasks and in choice reaction time tasks where more options slow you down early, then training makes you faster.
