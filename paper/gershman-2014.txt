This paper addresses a major puzzle in neuroscience. The classic theory states that dopamine signals "reward prediction error"—a spike of activity when an outcome is better than expected. However, recent experiments found that as a rat gets closer to a reward, its dopamine levels don't just spike at the end but instead ramp up gradually. This "ramping" seems to contradict the prediction error theory, suggesting instead that dopamine simply signals *proximity* to a goal. This paper argues that the classic theory can, in fact, explain these ramps without needing to be replaced.

- The pivotal study that observed dopamine "ramping" was conducted by Howe and colleagues. In their experiment, they measured dopamine levels in the striatum (a key brain region for motivation and action) while rats navigated a T-maze to find a chocolate milk reward. The classic "reward prediction error" theory would predict a small dopamine spike when the rat saw a cue indicating the reward, and a large spike only upon receiving the reward itself. However, Howe et al. found something strikingly different: as the rat ran down the arm of the maze toward the goal, its dopamine levels began to rise steadily and gradually, creating a ramp-like pattern that peaked at the exact moment the rat reached the reward location. This ramping was not a brief phasic spike but a prolonged, sustained increase in dopamine concentration over several seconds.

- The interpretation that this ramping signals "proximity" was made directly by the authors of the study, Howe and colleagues (2013). The title of their paper explicitly states that this dopamine signaling "signals proximity and value of distant rewards." They argued that this gradual ramp was too slow and sustained to be a classic prediction error signal. Instead, its shape perfectly mirrored the rat's journey through space—the closer the rat got to the goal, the higher the dopamine level. They proposed this was a distinct form of dopamine signaling that functions as a motivational "you're getting warmer" signal, encoding both physical closeness to a goal and the expected value of that goal. This interpretation was seen as a major challenge to the dominant theory, a view echoed by other prominent neuroscientists.

The basic problem is that it's a known observation that dopamine increases and decreases with proximity. Which is weird, because what exactly is the prediction error that leads to such a smooth translation of proximity to dopamine? If the value of getting closer to the goal increased in a simple, linear way, then the change at every single step would be identical. Your prediction error signal would be a constant, flat line, not a ramp. 

Gershman's claim is that the solution lies not in changing the dopamine model, but in understanding how the brain represents space. He proposes that the brain doesn't encode distance to a goal linearly (e.g., 10 feet, 9 feet, 8 feet). Instead, it uses a "convex" or compressed representation, where the perceived change in value is much greater for steps taken close to the goal than for steps taken far away. Specifically, if the brain's internal "map" represents proximity quadratically (as the square of the distance), then feeding this distorted spatial information into the standard prediction error model naturally produces an approximately linear dopamine ramp.

-- If a hill has a constant, straight slope, then every step you take brings you the same amount closer, and your sense of progress would be a flat, constant signal, not a ramp. To make that signal ramp up, the hill needs to get steeper as you approach the top. This way, each step you take feels more significant and provides a bigger "jump" in value than the last.  squared function creates exactly this effect: it describes a curve (a parabola) that starts out flat and gets progressively steeper in a perfectly linear fashion. Therefore, by squaring the representation of proximity, the brain creates an internal value "hill" with a constantly increasing slope, ensuring that the prediction error signal—the perceived progress at each step—ramps up in a smooth, straight line all the way to the goal.
