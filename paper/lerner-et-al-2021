The paper says dopamine’s main job is still a “better or worse than expected” teaching pulse. That is reward prediction error. They walk through strong causal evidence from blocking and optogenetics that dopamine bursts are the error signal, not the value itself. In other words, dopamine does not store “how good” a cue is. It stamps learning when outcomes beat the forecast, and it withholds the stamp when they do not. Predicted value seems to live in the inputs to dopamine, like cortex, not in the dopamine neurons themselves. That point fits your split between fast limbic value and slower goal value, because it places the slow, computed stuff upstream, and keeps dopamine as the final stamp that arrives on time. 

They then widen RPE in three helpful ways. First, dopamine can carry sensory prediction errors, not only scalar payoff. That means “the strawberry smell was different today” can drive a teaching pulse even when calories are the same. Second, different dopamine cells encode optimistic or pessimistic slices of the error, like a spread of betting styles. That is a distributional code. Third, the error depends on belief states when the world is ambiguous. The brain carries a best guess about “where we are” and computes the error relative to that. Put simply, the paper keeps the RPE frame, then shows how timing, content, and uncertainty shape it. Your limbic-versus-higher mix slides into this nicely, because the fast limbic channel changes timing and gain on the very same error, while the slower channel edits the belief and the prediction that the error is compared against. 

They also hit heterogeneity hard. Not all dopamine neurons do the same thing. VTA subgroups support unblocking and classic RPE. Some SNc groups do not look like strict RPE even though they reinforce behavior. There are cells that echo movement kinematics, and there is co-release of glutamate or GABA at some terminals. On top of that, the famous “ramps” that rise as an animal nears reward can reflect motivation, or RPE spread, or both, depending on task and readout. The take-home is simple. The stamp travels through many subtypes and terminals, which is why quick limbic cues and slower plan-related inputs can influence the very same downstream learning loop. Different clocks, one teacher pulse.
