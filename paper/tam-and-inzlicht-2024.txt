This study explores a common behavior in the digital age: constantly switching between videos or fast-forwarding through content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. The researchers first confirmed the intuitive reason we do this—we switch to escape boredom. Across several experiments, they demonstrated that when people felt bored, they were much more likely to skip to the next video. They also found that people believe this strategy works; they predict they will be less bored and more satisfied if they have the freedom to switch content whenever they please.

The central and most surprising finding, however, is that this strategy completely backfires. *In a series of controlled experiments, participants who were given the freedom to switch between videos actually reported feeling more bored, less satisfied, and less engaged than participants who were required to watch a single video without interruption.* This paradoxical effect held true even when people were watching videos of their own choosing on YouTube. The very act of "digital switching," which we use to avoid tedium, seems to inadvertently make us feel worse.

The researchers suggest this happens because constant switching prevents us from ever fully immersing ourselves in the content. By always looking for the next, more stimulating thing, our attention remains shallow, and we never get "lost" in the experience, which is where real enjoyment and meaning come from. The awareness of infinite other options may also create a "fear of missing out," making it harder to be content with what's in front of us. Ultimately, the research indicates that enjoyment is better achieved by committing to a video and immersing ourselves in it, rather than constantly swiping in a futile search for something better.

Crucially, the research demonstrated that these momentary experiences of guilt have downstream effects on overall well-being. The study found that increased mindless scrolling over the course of a day was associated with small negative changes in daily affective well-being (Vicente et al., 2024). This relationship was partially mediated by the accumulated guilt experienced during that same day. These findings suggest that the subjective experience of mindless scrolling—specifically the goal conflict and subsequent guilt it generates—can negatively impact a person’s overall affective state, highlighting the importance of considering psychological appraisals and self-perceptions when studying the effects of social media use.
