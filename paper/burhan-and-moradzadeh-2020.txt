This article explains that social media platforms can become addictive by exploiting the brain's natural reward system, which is driven by the neurotransmitter dopamine. While often called the "pleasure chemical," dopamine is more accurately involved in motivation and anticipation. It is the chemical that makes us seek out things that might feel good. Social media apps are designed to trigger this system, creating a powerful drive for users to constantly check for updates and notifications, similar to the urge experienced in other addictive behaviors like gambling.

The core of this addictive potential lies in a "feedback loop" created by unpredictable rewards. Like playing a slot machine, users don't know when they will receive a "reward" such as a like, comment, or message. This unpredictability, known as a variable reward schedule, causes dopamine levels to spike in anticipation of a potential social reward. Each time a user checks their phone and receives a notification, the brain gets a small dopamine hit, which reinforces the checking behavior and keeps the user caught in a cycle of seeking more engagement.
