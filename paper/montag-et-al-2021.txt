This 2021 article published in Frontiers in Public Health explores the psychological motivations behind TikTok use, noting that the platform's immersive design with features like the "For You" page, "Likes," and endless personalized content contributes to prolonged user engagement. The primary drivers for using TikTok, according to uses and gratification theory, are the fulfillment of entertainment and affective needs. These include the desire to expand social networks, seek fame, and express creativity. Other theories, such as Social Impact Theory and Self-Determination Theory, are also considered relevant for understanding how users are motivated by influence and a sense of competence, autonomy, and connection.
