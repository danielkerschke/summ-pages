Scalvini, M. (2023). Making sense of responsibility: A semio-ethic perspective on TikTok's algorithmic pluralism. Social Media + Society, April-June 2023, 1â€“14. https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231180625

This study investigates the complex and often contradictory experience of using TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Through 40 in-depth interviews with young users, the author explores a central tension: while users praise TikTok for its inclusivity and diversity, they also recognize that the algorithm can limit their exposure to new ideas by feeding them a constant stream of similar content. The research aims to understand how users perceive the platform's ethical responsibilities and how they navigate the difference between content that feels diverse and content that is merely repetitive.

The findings show that users overwhelmingly perceive TikTok as a positive and safe space, especially when compared to other social media platforms. They celebrate it for showcasing a wide range of body types, races, gender identities, and perspectives, which they feel fosters a sense of authenticity and community. Users feel that TikTok allows them to see "real people" and engage with content that is raw and unfiltered, contributing to a feeling of inclusivity and breaking down traditional beauty standards. This apparent diversity is seen as a moral good and is a primary reason for the platform's appeal.

However, the study also reveals that users are aware of the algorithm's manipulative and addictive nature. They notice that the "For You" page often shows them repetitive videos that are nearly identical in sound, theme, or the physical appearance of the creators, creating a "visual bubble." This endless, personalized feed is designed to be compulsive, leading to "binge-scrolling" and a feeling of lost time. This creates a paradox where the algorithm feels inclusive while simultaneously trapping users in a narrow loop of content that keeps them engaged but not necessarily exposed to genuinely different viewpoints.

Ultimately, the author argues that TikTok's algorithm creates an "illusion of pluralism" rather than true diversity. It excels at generating socially desirable content that makes users feel comfortable and accepted within their in-group, but it does so by erasing genuine difference and promoting a form of digital conformism. Instead of fostering a community that embraces true otherness, the algorithm offers a simulated diversity of endless, similar variations. The study concludes that advancing the concept of "algorithmic pluralism" is crucial for evaluating the ethical responsibilities of platforms and understanding how their designs shape our perceptions of ourselves and the world.
