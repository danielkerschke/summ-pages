De Block, A., & Du Laing, B. (2010). Amusing ourselves to death? Superstimuli and the evolutionary social sciences. Philosophical Psychology, 23(6), 821â€“843. https://doi.org/10.1080/09515089.2010.529048

The paper begins by exploring a captivating and unsettling idea, famously posed by evolutionary psychologists like Geoffrey Miller and Steven Pinker: that advanced civilizations, including our own, might be "amusing themselves to death." The core of this argument lies in the concept of the superstimulus. This is an exaggerated version of a natural stimulus that our brains evolved to find appealing. For example, our ancestors evolved a taste for sweet, energy-rich fruit and fatty meat. Modern "pleasure technologies" like strawberry cheesecake concentrate these features into a "sensual wallop" far more intense than anything found in nature. According to this view, pornography, video games, and junk food are all superstimuli that hijack our ancient pleasure circuits, providing the cues for evolutionary success (like food, status, and sex) without the actual fitness benefits, potentially leading a species to prioritize pleasure over survival and reproduction.
