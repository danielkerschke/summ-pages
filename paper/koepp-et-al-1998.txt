In this landmark study, researchers set out to measure dopamine release in the human brain during a complex, rewarding activity. To do this, they used positron emission tomography (PET) scans and a radioactive tracer called ¹¹C-raclopride, which binds to dopamine D2 receptors. Eight volunteers were scanned twice: once while resting and looking at a blank screen (baseline), and once while playing a video game that involved navigating a tank and receiving a monetary reward for success. The core principle of the experiment is that the injected tracer competes with the brain's natural dopamine for the same receptor sites. Therefore, if playing the game caused the brain to release its own dopamine, there would be fewer available receptors for the tracer to bind to, resulting in a weaker signal.

The results provided direct evidence that playing the video game triggered a significant release of dopamine. Researchers observed a marked decrease in tracer binding in a deep brain region called the striatum during the game compared to the resting scan. This effect was strongest in the ventral striatum, an area critically involved in motivation, reinforcement, and reward processing. Furthermore, the study revealed a powerful correlation: the better a participant performed in the game, the greater the reduction in tracer binding, indicating a larger release of dopamine. This showed that the brain's chemical reward system was not just active, but was responding in direct proportion to the level of achievement in the task.

This study was groundbreaking because it was one of the first to demonstrate, non-invasively, that a purely behavioral and cognitive task could induce measurable changes in a specific neurotransmitter system in the human brain. It provided a powerful bridge between findings in animal research and human experience, confirming the central role of dopamine in goal-directed behavior, learning, and motivation. The research helps explain the neurochemical basis for why challenging and rewarding activities are so engaging and compelling, and it laid the foundation for future studies on the neurobiology of addiction, learning, and psychiatric disorders involving the dopamine system.
